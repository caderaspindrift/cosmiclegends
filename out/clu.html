<h2 id="safety">Safety Tools</h2>
<p>Playing the <span class="gamename"></span> RPG should be enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>To ensure that everyone has an enjoyable experience, we recommend the <em>TTRPG Safety Toolkit</em>, which we’ve included below. You should not play <span class="gamename"></span> without using at least one such tool in your game.</p>
<p>In addition, we specifically call out certain points in the rules that need special attention from Game Guides and players. These are marked with an <span class="cw">alert symbol</span>.</p>
<div class="tstoolkit">
<h3 id="what-are-safety-tools">What are safety tools?</h3>
<p>Sometimes games have content or situations where a player or GM may feel stressed out, unsafe, or otherwise not having fun. Safety tools are a way for players and GMs to communicate and check-in before, during, and after a game in order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and to provide the right support when needed.</p>
<p>Communication, trust, and care The key to safety tools is communication and trust. There needs to be open and respectful communication alongside a culture of trust for these to work.</p>
<p>As a GM, player, or organizer, you can create this culture by making it clear that the care and well-being of everyone at the table comes before the game or story. This can be done by actively listening to everyone, offering accomodations and safety tools, implementing actions when asked while not prying (nobody owes you their trauma as explanation), and actively checking in before, during, and after a game.</p>
<h3 id="the-toolkit">The toolkit</h3>
<p>Different safety tools work better for different people and games. Finding the ones that best suit the needs of everyone at the table is important, and should be facilitated through discussion at the start of every new game or new group.</p>
<p>This guide provides summaries of some safety tools and techniques (with the original designers’ permission) to add to your own toolkit. This includes the <strong>X-card system</strong>, the <strong>Script Change RPG Toolbox</strong>, the <strong>Luxton Technique</strong>, and more. Sources and links are provided at the end of this guide for the full original materials, and the toolkit is regularly updated with new tools.</p>
<h4 id="before-the-game-begins">Before the Game Begins</h4>
<h5 id="session-0">Session 0</h5>
<p>Session 0s are a great way to begin communication, set expectations on the kind of story and play, and introduce and discuss what safety tools will be used at the table.</p>
<h5 id="lines-and-veils">Lines and Veils</h5>
<p><strong>Lines and veils</strong> are used to set boundaries on content in a game.</p>
<p><strong>Lines</strong> are hard limits on content, things that the GM or the players don’t want to engage in. Setting up a line means that content won’t show up in the game at all.</p>
<p><strong>Veils</strong> are soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means that the content might be in the game but not spotlighted or described in great detail.</p>
<p><strong>Lines and veils</strong> can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.</p>
<h5 id="script-change-rating">Script Change Rating</h5>
<p><strong>Script Change</strong> ratings are used to set tone and boundaries for your game. Using film ratings (or your own), you can outline what audience you’re playing for (e.g. PG-13 vs R).</p>
<p>The <strong>rating</strong> also addresses what content players do want to see as well as what they don’t want to see. Make sure to balance and respect everyone’s do and don’t wants.</p>
<p><strong>Ratings</strong> and do-and-don’t-want content can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.</p>
<h5 id="luxton-technique-discussion">Luxton Technique Discussion</h5>
<p>In the <strong>Luxton Technique</strong>, have an open discussion between everyone at the table about potential trauma triggers. This is with the understanding that it’s not possible to identify every single possible trigger or trauma, and that there is no social pressure to go into details or individual justifications for a trigger.</p>
<h4 id="during-the-game">During the Game</h4>
<h5 id="x-n-and-o-cards">X, N, and O Cards</h5>
<p><strong>X</strong>, <strong>N</strong>, and <strong>O cards</strong> are check-in tools. They can be used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the video conference software or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone that they are available and how to use them.</p>
<p>The <strong>X card</strong> can be used at any point if a participant is uncomfortable with the content happening in-game. When the <strong>X card</strong> is used by tapping the card or typing an <strong>“X”</strong> in the chat, the group can change, rewind, or skip the content.</p>
<p>The <strong>N card</strong> can be used at any point if a participant feels like they are headed towards an X. When the <strong>N card</strong> is used by tapping the card or typing an <strong>“N”</strong> in the chat, the group can change the content or have the scene “fade to black.”</p>
<p>The <strong>O card</strong> can be used at any point if a participant wants to continue with the content. When the <strong>O card</strong> is used by tapping the card or typing an <strong>“O”</strong> in the chat, the group is ok to continue with the content. They can also regularly be prompted by a <strong>“O?”</strong> asked out loud or in the chat to check-in if everyone is still ok.</p>
<h4 id="script-change">Script Change</h4>
<p>The <strong>Script Change RPG Toolbox</strong> is a collection of tools that can be used to adjust play and content. They can be used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the video conference software or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand signals. Before the game begins, remind your players that they are available and how to use them.</p>
<p><span class="icon rewind">Rewind</span> can be used when something has happened in play that makes a participant uncomfortable. When <span class="icon rewind">Rewind</span> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to rewind…”), be clear about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a point before it happened, and play starts again.</p>
<p><span class="icon ff">Fast Forward</span> can be used when a participant would like to skip past uncomfortable content or to the next part of the story for pacing. When <span class="icon ff">Fast Forward</span> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to fast forward…”), skip forward to a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.</p>
<p><span class="icon pause">Pause</span> can be used when things are too intense, but you still want to continue playing the scene. When <span class="icon pause">Pause</span> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to pause…”), you can take a break and/or discuss the content as needed. After the <span class="icon pause">Pause</span>, you can <span class="icon resume">Resume</span>, <span class="icon rewind">Rewind</span>, <span class="icon ff">Fast Forward</span>.</p>
<p><span class="icon resume">Resume</span> can be used when everyone is ready to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing content. When <span class="icon resume">Resume</span> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“Let’s resume…”), continue with play.</p>
<h5 id="luxton-technique">Luxton Technique</h5>
<p>With the <strong>Luxton Technique</strong>, when a participant comes across triggering content in play, they can choose to discuss it with the other people at the table.</p>
<p>The participant is given complete control over that content, expressed as a need or want for how play will continue. This can include in-game directions for plot and characters, as well as out of game needs such as breaks.</p>
<p>After the need and wants are expressed, everyone continues play to accomodate the requests.</p>
<h5 id="open-door">Open Door</h5>
<p>The <strong>Open Door</strong> is the assurance that someone can leave or take a break from the game for their own safety and well-being without being judged. State this at the beginning and periodically throughout the game.</p>
<h5 id="breaks">Breaks</h5>
<p>For games longer than 2 hours or games that have intense content, having a short built-in break is recommended to allow people to stay focused and process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any other needs during this time.</p>
<h4 id="after-the-game">After the Game</h4>
<h5 id="bleed">Bleed</h5>
<p>Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships between players and GM if not worked through.</p>
<p>Being open and honest about where the game begins and ends, and being conscious of which feelings belong to the player and which are just bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.</p>
<h5 id="aftercare">Aftercare</h5>
<p>Together as a group after the game, check-in with everyone to see how they are feeling. This is an open way for everyone to emotionally decompress, talk through, and process the events of the session in a safe environment.</p>
<p>Encourage everyone to practice their own forms of self-care and remind them that their mental health comes first.</p>
<h5 id="debriefing">Debriefing</h5>
<p>Debriefing as a group is a great way to reflect on the game, identify possible issues, highlight the fun things to continue, and work through potential bleed. Debriefing can happen right after the game or in the days following the stream.</p>
<h5 id="stars-and-wishes">Stars and Wishes</h5>
<p><strong>Stars and wishes</strong> are used to reflect on the session and communicate feedback in a positive and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go around and get everyone to state a star and wish.</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong> are things that the participants really enjoyed and loved about the game. This could include a particular moment of roleplay, an encounter created by the GM, or anything else that stuck out as something awesome during the game.</p>
<p><strong>Wishes</strong> are things that the participants would like to see in future sessions. This could include particular interactions between characters, potential story moments and development, or anything else that could make the game even better in the future.</p>
<h5 id="highlight-reel-and-wrap-session">Highlight Reel and Wrap Session</h5>
<p>Similar to <strong>stars and wishes</strong>, Script Change has <strong>Highlight Reel</strong> and <strong>Wrap Session</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Highlight Reel</strong> is used to reflect on the session and highlight moments participants enjoyed. At the end of the game, go around and get everyone to state highlight of the game for them. This could include a particular moment of roleplay, an encounter created by the GM, or anything else that stuck out as something awesome during the game.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wrap Session</strong> is an opportunity for the group to reflect on the session and discuss what could be improved going forward. At the end of the game, go around and open up discussion about the game. This could include content participants didn’t feel comfortable calling pause or rewind at the time, or talking about emotional impacts and bleed.</p>
<p>There should be no social pressure to disclose the details or trauma to justify why someone felt uncomfortable or unsafe during the game, as long as the discussion moves towards how to address the issues going forward.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="toc-dice">Rolling Dice</h2>
<p>The dice mechanic in <span class="gamename"></span> is a pool of six-sided dice. When players want to take an uncertain action, they build a dice pool.</p>
<ul>
<li>One die for every point they have in the relevant Facet</li>
<li>One die for every Volume if they have a relevant Skill</li>
<li>Two dice if they can mark off a relevant part of their Motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>Any dice that come up a 5 or a 6 are counted as Successes. A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).</p>
<p>Any dice that come up 2, 3, or 4 are ignored.</p>
<p>Any dice that come up 1 are counted as Edge Successes. When a player rolls a 1, they inform the Editor, who offers them a consequence.</p>
<p>If the player chooses to take the Editor’s consequence, they count the 1 as a Success.</p>
<p>This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. The important part is that the player is presented with a difficult choice.</p>
<h2 id="toc-issues">Issues, Story Arcs, Series, and Volumes</h2>
<p>An adventure in <span class="gamename"></span> is known as a Story. A Story consists of one or more Crises introduced by the Editor, and the heroes’ reactions to those challenges.</p>
<p>Each individual game session is known as an Issue. Most Stories will resolve over one Issue, but some can take longer.</p>
<p>When you create a new hero, you define a Story Arc that describes a specific lesson you’d like them to learn or a specific experience you’d like them to have. Once your hero finishes your Story Arc, both your hero and your fellow players’ heroes gain an Advancement.</p>
<p>A ongoing campaign of <span class="gamename"></span> is known as a Series, and each Series is comprised of up to five Volumes, beginning with Volume 1.</p>
<p>Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Story Arcs, the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue that ties together the previous Story Arcs, and that Volume ends.</p>
<p>At the end of a Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds new ways to use their existing powers.</p>
<h2 id="toc-chargen">Hero Creation</h2>
<p>To create your hero, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a Class
<ul>
<li>Pick six Personal Power Words from your Class</li>
<li>Pick your Skills, based on your Class</li>
<li>Pick a Volume 1 ability from your Class</li>
<li>Choose 2 words as your Nova Power</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assign 1 point to each Facet, then distribute more 5 points as you wish</li>
<li>Choose 5 words as Motivations</li>
<li>Pick a Fighting Style</li>
<li>Create a Story Arc you’d like to play out with your hero</li>
<li>Choose a Hero Name, Pronouns, and a Real Name, and decide whether the latter is a Secret Identity</li>
<li>Describe your Costume, Symbol, and General Appearance</li>

<h2 id="toc-facets">Facets</h2>
<p>Each hero’s nature is defined by their scores in 5 different facets, which represent their approaches to solving problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong> - a direct, straight-forward approach</li>
<li><strong>Adventure</strong> - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations</li>
<li><strong>Detective</strong> - a logical approach, based on gathering information</li>
<li><strong>Mystery</strong> - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions</li>
<li><strong>Suspense</strong> - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of your hero’s facets start with a score of 1, and you have 5 additional points to distribute to them.</p>
<section id="designers-note-facets" class="sidebar">
<h2>Designer’s Note: Facets</h2>
<p>These Facets – named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles – were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, or as wise or charming as they like.</p>
<p>The other reason for these Facets is that the concept of Intelligence as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, including racial and class injustice.</p>
<p>We chose “Detective” as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve problems by thinking about them and gathering information, not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.</p>
</section>
<h2 id="toc-motivation">Motivations</h2>
<p>Your hero has five Motivations that drive them to feats of heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen by you when you create your hero; there’s no set list.</p>
<p>For example, one hero could have these five Motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truth</li>
<li>Justice</li>
<li>Responsibility</li>
<li>Restraint</li>
<li>Hope</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use all five of your hero’s Motivations in a Story Arc, your hero’s Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you unlock your Nova Power Words and can use those until the end of current Story Arc.</p>
<p>When a new Story Arc begins, all the marked off Motivations are cleared and it’s time to start again.</p>
<h2 id="toc-skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their civilian life – from their secret identity, their profession before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training.</p>
<p>The Skills are:</p>

<h2 id="toc-fighting-style">Fighting Style</h2>
<p>Your hero specializes in one style of fighting, whether they attack with their fists or their powers. Those styles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acrobat</strong> Reduce by 1 the cost to avoid a move targeting only you.</li>
<li><strong>Brawler</strong> Add 1 when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal.</li>
<li><strong>Controller</strong> Add 1 when you use a Power to advance the Outwit goal.</li>

<p>If you choose the Knight class, you get to pick an additional fighting style.</p>
<h2 id="toc-chargen-powers">Powers</h2>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h2 id="toc-chargen-nova-power">Nova Power</h2>
<p>Like Motivations, you can choose any two words you like for your hero’s Nova Power Words.</p>
<p>When you complete your Motivations list, you have access to those two Power Words, which you can use separately or collectively in Power Stunts until the current Story Arc is over.</p>
<p>Your Nova Power can be anything; you’re encouraged to use your Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.<br />
Nova Power Words might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soaring Dragon</li>
<li>Berserker Rage</li>
<li>Indomitable Spirit</li>
<li>Solar Flare</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc-chargen-identity">Your Hero’s Identity</h2>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h2 id="toc-powers">Powers</h2>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-power-words">Power Words</h3>
<p>Your hero has a list of six words called Personal Power Words, chosen from the 15 Power Words associated with each class. You also have two Core Power words shared by every hero in that class.</p>
<p>In addition, you have two Nova Power Words that are unique to your hero; you can freely choose any two words you like for your Nova Power Words.</p>
<p>You can use your hero’s Power Words in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>Power Display</strong>, which uses a single Power Word</li>
<li>a <strong>Power Stunt</strong>, using two (or more) Power Words</li>
<li>a <strong>Power Combo</strong>, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc-power-displays">Power Displays</h3>
<p>When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word and explain how you’re using that power.</p>
<p>A Power Display doesn’t cost any Might points.</p>
<p>Power Displays don’t have a game-mechanics effect on your rolls, but you can use them to explain how you’re able to <em>make</em> those rolls.</p>
<p>For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to the skies to throw a punch.</p>
<p>If you don’t have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.</p>
<h3 id="toc-power-stunts">Power Stunts</h3>
<p>A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together, and unlike a Power Display, a Stunt will affect the result of your next roll. In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.</p>
<p>When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you’re hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory effects.</p>
<p>After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an appropriate roll for your Power Stunt – either to increase the Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an additional 1 Success to the Effectiveness of the roll based on your Stunt.</p>
<p>You don’t have to come up with Power Stunts beforehand; instead, you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.</p>
<p>For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase “Flight Speed”. Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt means that when you make a roll – such as rolling your Adventure Facet to Outwit a foe – increases your roll’s Effectiveness by 1 Success, even if you rolled 0 Successes.</p>
<h3 id="toc-power-words-core">Core Power Words</h3>
<p>In addition to your six Personal Power Words, your hero also has two <strong>Core Power Words</strong> common to all members of your class. You can use these as you would any other Power Words in Power Displays, Power Stunts, and Power Combos.</p>
<p>You can also use one of your Core Power Words as a <em>third</em> Power Word in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, and adds another 1 Success to the Effectiveness of a roll.</p>
<p>By spending 1 <em>more</em> Might point you can add your other Core Power Word as a <em>fourth</em> Power Word in a Power Stunt. Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 Successes on the rolls Effectiveness, but also costs you 3 Might points.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<h3 id="toc-power-combos">Power Combos</h3>
<p>A <strong>Power Combo</strong> is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work together, with their powers combined.</p>
<p>To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they’d like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you’re trying to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.</p>
<p>You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long as you can come up with an explanation of how they’re helping.</p>
<p>The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, and they’re called the initiating hero for that Combo.</p>
<p>A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt – the player of the initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them, spending 1 point of Might and increasing the Effectiveness of the next roll by 1 Success.</p>
<p>The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which increases the roll’s Effectiveness by 1 Success.</p>
<p>Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one of their Core Power Words as a <em>third</em> (or fourth) Power Word in the Combo.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<h3 id="toc-power-words-nova">Nova Power Words</h3>
<p>When you’ve completed your hero’s Motivations track, you unlock your <strong>Nova Power Words</strong> and can use them until the end of the current Story Arc.</p>
<p>You can use one of your Nova Power Words as the second Power Word in a Stunt without spending any Might; likewise, you can add use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the Nova Power Word still increases the roll’s Effectiveness by 1 Success.</p>
<p>Using your <em>other</em> Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or Power Combo requires spending 1 Might.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<h3 id="toc-power-words-scene">Scene Power Words</h3>
<p>The scene also has its Power Words that describe the environment around your heros. The Editor comes up with these when describing a place, and can suggest how to use them if you ask. These are known as Scene Power Words.</p>
<p>You can use one Scene Power Word as a second power in a Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, but they still contribute 1 Success to the Effectiveness of a roll.</p>
<p>Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, and it likewise increases the Effectiveness of that Combo.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<h2 id="toc-classes">Classes</h2>
<p>The classes are:</p>
<h2 id="class">Class</h2>
<p>The Divine The Knight The Monarch The Paragon</p>

<p>A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need to present at the start of a Crisis.</p>
<p>The steps to take before a Crisis are:</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Set the Scene</li>
<li>Determine who is Present</li>
<li>Define the Goals</li>
<li>Assemble the Teamwork Pool</li>
<li>The Crisis begins!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-scene">Setting the Scene</h3>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-present">Determining Who is Present</h3>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-goals">Defining the Goals</h3>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-pool">Assembling the Teamwork Pool</h3>
<p>When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving a Crisis.</p>
<p>If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using a Facet related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for their heroes.</p>
<p>If your hero is <em>not</em> on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it’s being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.</p>
<p>Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, it’s time to start.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-start">Starting a Crisis</h3>
<p>Instead of having an initiative order like many games of this type, there are two phases that alternate back and forth: the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase.</p>
<p>The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is the Hero Phase.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-hero">Hero Phase</h3>
<p>The heroes can each take one action during the Hero Phase, one at a time, in any order they like.</p>
<p>While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially three things you can choose to do: Advance a Goal, Contribute to the Teamwork Pool, or Save Innocents.</p>
<p>If your hero is <em>not</em> present, you can use the Timely Arrival action.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-timely">Timely Arrival</h3>
<p>When you use the Timely Arrival action, spend 5 successes from the Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current Hero Phase.</p>
<p>You can’t take any other actions that turn, but you <em>can</em> describe your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<p>The cost of the Timely Arrival action decreases by 1 success every Crisis Phase.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-alert">General Alert</h3>
<p>If two or more heroes aren’t present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at the scene can use their turn to sound a General Alert and call for help. The cost of a General Alert is 1 success per hero called.</p>
<p>The heroes arrive at the start of the <em>next</em> Hero Phase, and can act normally during that turn. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike a Timely Arrival, they don’t roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-advance">Advance a Goal</h3>
<p>When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the Crisis. There are three different ways of doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smash</strong> - defeating the Crisis through physical damage</li>
<li><strong>Outwit</strong> - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis</li>
<li><strong>Withstand</strong> - outlast the Crisis, taking all it can throw at you</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to advance it once. You don’t need to roll all these successes at once; you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too.</p>
<p>Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, the Crisis ends. The players have successfully Smashed, Outwitted, or Withstood the danger.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-contribute">Contribute to the Teamwork Pool</h3>
<p>When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything you can think of that might give your team an edge.</p>
<p>You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes.</p>
<p>When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-saving">Saving Innocents</h3>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-crisis">Crisis Phase</h3>
<p>Once every hero has taken an action, then it’s time for the Editor to take their turn.</p>
<p>Every Crisis has a set number of turns per round. As a rule, the more actions a Crisis gets per turn, the more difficult it is. If the Crisis has the same number of actions as the hero team, it will be very challenging.</p>
<p>The Editor chooses actions from the Encounter’s list. Every action has a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes from the Teamwork Pool, they defend against the attack and nothing happens.</p>
<p>For every action the Crisis tries to take, the heroes have an opportunity to spend successes from the Teamwork Pool to defend. If there aren’t enough successes in the pool to defend, or if the heroes decide not to defend, then the action happens and the heroes face the consequences.</p>
<p>Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting the heroes’ ability to use a certain type of roll on their next turn, or innocents being endangered.</p>
<p>Once the Editor has taken enough actions, it’s time to go back to the heroes.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-post">Post-Crisis</h3>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h2 id="toc-advancements">Advancements</h2>
<p>After each Story Arc concludes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose one Advancement from the following list; you can only add a Skill, Fighting Style, or Power Word once per Volume.
<ul>
<li>Increase your Health by 1.</li>
<li>Increase your Might by 1.</li>
<li>Add one Skill.</li>
<li>Add one Power Word from any class.</li>
<li>Add one Fighting Style.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you were the Spotlight Hero, increase any one Facet by 1.</li>
<li>(optional) Change one of your Motivations to any other word.</li>
<li>(optional) Change your Story Arc if you haven’t already completed it.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of each Volume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a new Class ability from the new Volume or a previous Volume.</li>
<li>Create a new Story Arc for the new Volume.</li>
