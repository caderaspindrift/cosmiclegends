<h2 class="colbefore" id="toc-ethos">Ethos</h2>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> revolves around the following three pillars:</p>
<h3 id="self-expression">Self Expression</h3>
<p>The Power Word system and Crisis system are intentionally built to give players freedom to engage with problems in their own style. <span class="gamename"></span> lets you be yourself, and do things in your own way, without being left behind by your team.</p>
<h3 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h3>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> games is written to encourage the players to work together. Whether you’re combining your powers to use Power Combos or using your skills to overcome an opponent together, heroes in <span class="gamename"></span> succeed or fail as a team.</p>
<h3 id="difficult-choices">Difficult Choices</h3>
<p>The Edge Success system is built so that you have the freedom to choose failure. The Crisis system is built so that you can choose to take big hits. Good things and bad things happen to your hero, and both of these are in the your hands to choose. The Editor’s job is to give you those difficult choices.</p>
<div id="soapbox-no-fascists" class="soapbox">
<h2 id="no-fascists">No Fascists</h2>
<p>If you’re a fascist, you’re not welcome to play this game. It’s against the rules.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this and thinking, “You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist,” then you’re probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic.</p>
<p>Don’t play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. Watch some <a href="https://www.misterrogers.org/">Mister Roger’s Neighborhood</a> or something.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-preface">A Four-Color Bronze Age Superhero TTRPG</h2>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="four-color">“Four-Color”</h3>
<p>The term “four-color” refers to the printing process used in comics that led to most heroes having bold, primary colors for their uniforms, their bodies, their worlds.</p>
<p>One example is Superman’s hair having <em>blue</em> overtones – this was meant to display his hair as a lustrous black but the capabilities time precluded that.</p>
<p><em>Our</em> use of the term “four-color” doesn’t refer to the print process for this game but instead to the general tone of late Silver Age and Bronze Age comics – when primary-color superheroes of the ’50s and ’60s met the social issues of the ’70s and ’80s.</p>
<h3 id="the-super-friends">The Super Friends</h3>
<p>In case you didn’t notice, this game is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends">Super Friends</a> cartoon show that was on the air from 1973 to 1985 – also the years yours truly was age 5 and 16. It’s fair to say the show influenced how I view comics and superheroes in general.</p>
<p>The first season has this great opening monologue where the four heroes were “created from the cosmic legends of the universe!”</p>
<p>What on earth does <em>that</em> mean? How exactly was <em>Bruce Wayne</em> created from the <strong>cosmic legends of the universe</strong>?! I’ve never figured that out, but it does make a great title for this Bronze Age-inspired, four-color tabletop RPG.</p>
<h3 id="the-ages-of-comics">The Ages of Comics</h3>
<p>American comics fans and scholars divide the history of comics into four loosely defined “ages”: the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Modern Age.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The Golden Age - 1938 to 1956</dt>
<dd><p>The Golden Age started with the introduction of Superman and the concept of superheroes in general. Many of the most well-known characters, such as Wonder Woman and Captain America, were created during the Golden Age.</p>
<p>Some comics in the Golden Age were simplistic fun, while others featured dark themes, shocking gore, and vile villains. A lot of Nazis were punched in those comics, which is always a good thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, racism and sexism often were major themes in Golden Age comics; examples of anti-Asian hatred are all too easy to find.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Silver Age - 1956 to circa 1970</dt>
<dd><p>The Silver Age began when DC Comics created new versions of the Flash, Green Lantern, and others, then the Justice League of America. Marvel responded by creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Avengers, the Hulk, the X-Men, and more.</p>
<p>The Silver Age also saw the creation of the Comics Code Authority, a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic over the content of comics.</p>
<p>Superhero comics in the Silver Age followed a long list of restrictions banning everything from “horror” and “gore” to “vampires” and “cannibalism”. Heroes always won, villains always lost, and authority figures were portrayed with respect – at least, that’s what the Comics Code demanded.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Bronze Age - ca. 1970 to ca. 1985</dt>
<dd><p>The Bronze Age is less distinctly defined chronologically, but was a time when comics went through changes: becoming more socially relevant and less restrained by the CCA. More on that later.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Modern Age - ca. 1985 to present</dt>
<dd><p>The current age of comics is usually dated to DC’s <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> and Marvel’s <em>Secret Wars</em>.</p>
<p>Modern superhero comics often feature antiheroes, complex storylines, and mature themes. Many of the older characters were revamped to more contemporary versions.</p>
<p>The CCA also withered away to nothing as the major publishers increasingly created comics without the CCA seal on the cover.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="the-bronze-age">The Bronze Age</h3>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-safety">Safety Tools</h2>
<p>Safety tools are a way for players and Editors to communicate and check-in <strong>before</strong>, <strong>during</strong>, and <strong>after</strong> a game in order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and to provide the right support when needed.</p>
<p>The key to safety tools is <strong>communication and trust</strong>. There needs to be open and respectful communication alongside a culture of trust for these to work.</p>
<p>Playing the <span class="gamename"></span> RPG should be enjoyable for everyone, and to help make that happen, we recommend the following techniques.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-game">Before the Game</h3>
<p>Before you even start playing an Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, talk about what you want to see in the game – and what you don’t want to see.</p>
<p>If you’re planning a long, open-ended Series, you may even want to devoted a whole session to this – called an <em>Issue 0</em> in <span class="gamename"></span>; for shorter games you should at least touch on these topics.</p>
<h4 id="lines-and-veils">Lines and Veils</h4>
<p><strong>Lines and veils</strong> are used to set boundaries on content in a game.</p>
<p><strong>Lines</strong> are hard limits on content, things that the Editor or the players don’t want to engage in. Setting up a line means that content won’t show up in the game at all.</p>
<p><strong>Veils</strong> are soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means that the content might be in the game but not spotlighted or described in great detail.</p>
<p><strong>Lines and veils</strong> can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.</p>
<h4 id="toc-comics-code">Using the Comics Code</h4>
<p>Don’t worry, I promise the CCA isn’t going to shut down your game.</p>
<p>Despite how terrible the <a href="http://cbldf.org/the-comics-code-of-1954/">Comics Code</a> was in reality – and it had a <em>stifling</em> effect on freedom of expression in comics for decades – it <em>does</em> give an interesting snapshot of the types of content that might show up in a Bronze Age superhero game.</p>
<p>The following questions are inspired by items in the Comics Code and are intended to start conversations – not end them!</p>
<p>As you discuss these questions as a group, anyone should feel free to request a line or veil on these or any other subjects.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="during-the-game">During the Game</h3>
<p>When you get caught up in playing <span class="gamename"></span>, it can sometimes be hard to gauge how everyone else is feeling. These tools can be used while you’re playing to make it easier to share.</p>
<h4 id="breaks">Breaks</h4>
<p>For Issues that run longer than 2 hours or Issues that have intense content, having a short built-in break is recommended to allow people to stay focused and process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any other needs during this time.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Editor should offer a break after a Crisis concludes. The players might not want one, in which case the game continues.</p>
<h4 id="open-door">Open Door</h4>
<p>The <strong>Open Door</strong> is the assurance that someone can leave or take a break from the game for their own safety and well-being without being judged. State this at the beginning and periodically throughout the game.</p>
<h4 id="toc-script-change">Comic Page Change Tools</h4>
<p>During play, you can use <strong>Comic Script Change Tools</strong> to adjust play and content. They can be used by tapping physical cards with the words written on them, typing the first letter of the move in the chat function of the video conference software or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand signals.</p>
<p>Before each Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, Editors and players should discuss how to use each of these tools.</p>
<p><strong>Retcon</strong> can be used when something has happened in play that makes a participant uncomfortable. When <strong>Retcon</strong> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to retcon…”), be clear about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a point before it happened, and play starts again.</p>
<p><strong>Later That Day, …</strong> can be used when a participant would like to skip past uncomfortable content or to the next part of the story for pacing. When <strong>Later</strong> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to go to later that day…”), skip forward to a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, …</strong> can be used when everyone is ready to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing content. When <strong>Meanwhile</strong> used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“Meanwhile…?”), continue with play if everyone agrees they’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>Continued Next Page</strong> can be used when things are too intense, but you still want to continue playing the scene. When <strong>Continued</strong> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to continue to the next page…”), you can take a break and/or discuss the content as needed. After the <strong>Continued</strong>, you can use <strong>Meanwhile</strong>, <strong>Retcon</strong>, or <strong>Later</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="after-the-game">After the Game</h3>
<p>When you finish an Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, it’s important to look back at the things you enjoyed the most and the things you didn’t like as much.</p>
<h4 id="bleed">Bleed</h4>
<p>Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships between players and Editor if not worked through.</p>
<p>Being open and honest about where the game begins and ends, and being conscious of which feelings belong to the player and which are just bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.</p>
<h4 id="toc-stars-wishes">Stars and Wishes</h4>
<p><strong>Stars and wishes</strong> are used to reflect on the session and communicate feedback in a positive and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go around and get everyone to state a star and wish.</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong> are things that the participants really enjoyed and loved about the game. This could include a particular moment of roleplay, a Crisis created by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as something awesome during the game.</p>
<p><strong>Wishes</strong> are things that the participants would like to see in future sessions. This could include particular interactions between heroes, potential story moments and development, or anything else that could make the game even better in the future.</p>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-overview">Overview of Play</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="gamename"></span> is played as a series of <strong>Storylines</strong>, each taking up one or more game sessions, or <strong>Issues</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Before a new Storyline, the players decide who the <strong>Spotlight</strong> hero will be during that Storyline.</p></li>
<li><p>The player with the Spotlight tells the Editor what <strong>Opportunity</strong> they’d like their hero to experience.</p></li>
<li><p>The Editor shapes a series of <strong>Crises</strong> that let the Spotlight hero work through that Opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>Once each player has had the Spotlight to address their hero’s Opportunity, that <strong>Volume</strong> of the campaign wraps up with an <strong>Annual</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-dice">Using the Dice</h2>
<p>The dice mechanic in <span class="gamename"></span> is a <strong>dice pool</strong> of six-sided dice. When a player wants to take an uncertain action, they build a dice pool.</p>
<ul>
<li>One die for every point they have in the relevant Facet</li>
<li>One die for every Volume if they have a relevant Skill</li>
<li>Two dice if they can mark off one of their Ideals</li>
<li>One die for every Power Word beyond the first</li>
<li>Other dice from any other source</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Any dice that come up a 5 or a 6 are counted as Successes. A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).</p>
<p>Any dice that come up 2, 3, or 4 are ignored.</p>
<p>Any dice that come up 1 are counted as Edge Successes. When a player rolls a 1, they inform the Editor, who offers them a consequence.</p>
<p>If the player chooses to take the Editor’s consequence, they count the 1 as a Success.</p>
<p>This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. The important part is that the player is presented with a difficult choice.</p>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-issues">From Issues to Volumes</h2>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> uses some terms from comic books to talk about how the game is played.</p>
<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>
<p>Each individual game session is known as an <strong>Issue</strong>, and roughly corresponds to one issue of a comic book.</p>
<p>The <strong>First Issue</strong> is the first played session of an ongoing <span class="gamename"></span> campaigned played by a group – but first you should have an Issue 0.</p>
<h4 id="issue-0">Issue 0</h4>
<p><strong>Issue 0</strong> – known as <em>Session 0</em> in other games – is an Issue of a <span class="gamename"></span> Series when the players don’t roll dice and handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person is looking forward to playing.</p>
<p>Issue 0 takes place before the First Issue, and should go over the safety tools used in the game, stress the importance of open communication, and set expectations on the kind of story and play.</p>
<p>Issue 0s are also a great time to create heroes together as a group, rather than separately.</p>
<h3 id="storylines">Storylines</h3>
<p>During an Issue, the Editor and the players play out the events of a <strong>Storyline</strong>.</p>
<p>When you create a new hero, you define a specific lesson you’d like your hero to learn or a specific experience you’d like them to have. For that Storyline, your character is considered the <strong>Spotlight</strong> hero.</p>
<p>Each Storyline consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Spotlight hero</li>
<li>the Opportunity</li>
<li>one or more Crises connected to the Opportunity, introduced by the Editor</li>
<li>the heroes’ reactions to each Crisis</li>
<li>the Spotlight hero’s reaction the Opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Storylines will resolve over the course of one Issue, but some can take long and might run for 2 or 3 sessions, or longer.</p>
<p>Once your hero finishes your Storyline, both your hero and your fellow players’ heroes gain an <strong>Advancement.</strong></p>
<h4 id="one-shots">One-Shots</h4>
<p>A <strong>One-Shot</strong> is an Issue that isn’t part of a Storyline, Volume, or Series, but stands alone. Most games played at conventions, for example, will be One-Shots.</p>
<p>Sometimes a One-Shot doesn’t have a Spotlight hero, meaning there’s no Opportunity either, but just a connected series of Crises. In those cases, all heroes receive a standard Advancements after dealing with the Crises.</p>
<p>One-Shots obviously won’t have a separate Issue 0, but time should still be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on important safety tools.</p>
<p>Many First Issues are One-Shots, as the players and Editor are still getting to know their heroes and the game. These First Issues usually feature a few simple Crises to resolve.</p>
<h3 id="volumes">Volumes</h3>
<p>Each Storyline is part of a <strong>Volume</strong>; Volumes are a grouping of Issues – game sessions – and are numbered starting with 1.</p>
<p>Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Storylines, the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue, known as an <strong>Annual</strong>.</p>
<p>The Annual ties together the events of the previous Storylines in the Volume, and then that Volume concludes.</p>
<p>At the start of a new Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds new ways to use their existing powers.</p>
<h3 id="series">Series</h3>
<p>A ongoing campaign of <span class="gamename"></span> is known as a <strong>Series,</strong> and each Series is comprised of up to five Volumes.</p>
<p>If your group reaches the end of Volume 5 and with to continue with with the same heroes, you can do so: just treat later Volumes as having a Volume number of 5, and proceed from there.</p>
<h3 id="guest-stars-and-crossovers">Guest Stars and Crossovers</h3>
<p>A <strong>Guest Star</strong> is a hero character from another Series – either played by the same group or a different one – who plays in the Series for an Issue or two. If the Guest Star’s Volume number is higher than the group’s, temporarily lower the Guest Star to the same Volume.</p>
<p>A <strong>Crossover</strong> happens when the heroes from two or more Series work together, usually in large, wide-ranging One-Shots. All participating heroes keep their normal Volume numbers without adjustment.</p>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-chargen">Hero Origin</h2>
<p>To create your hero, you just follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pick a Class
<ul>
<li>Pick six Personal Power Words from your Class</li>
<li>Pick your Skills, based on your Class</li>
<li>Pick a Volume 1 ability from your Class</li>
<li>Choose 2 words as your Nova Power</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assign 1 point to each Facet, then distribute more 5 points as you wish</li>
<li>Pick a Fighting Style</li>
<li>Choose 5 words as Ideals</li>
<li>Describe a Storyline you’d like to play out with your hero</li>
<li>Decide your hero’s Appearance and Backstory
<ul>
<li>Choose a Hero Name, Pronouns, and a Real Name; and decide whether the latter is a Secret Identity</li>
<li>Describe your Costume, Symbol, and General Appearance</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hero-class">Hero Class</h3>
<p>A hero’s <em>Class</em> defines broad strokes of their powers, abilities, and methods. Classes are archetypes that define how your hero fits into a superhero world.</p>
<p>Each class gives the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two or more skills</li>
<li>A class ability</li>
<li>Two Core Power Words</li>
<li>Six Personal Power words</li>
<li>One class ability per Volume</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="toc-powers">Power Words</h3>
<p>Your hero has a list of words called Power Words that define their super-powers and how they use them. Power Words are used in three different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Power Display</strong>, which uses a single Power Word</li>
<li>A <strong>Power Stunt</strong>, using two (or more) Power Words</li>
<li>A <strong>Power Combo</strong>, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four types of Power Words:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Power Words</strong>, unique to your class</li>
<li><strong>Personal Power Words</strong>, picked from your class list</li>
<li><strong>Nova Power Words</strong>, unique to your hero</li>
<li><strong>Scene Power Words</strong>, based on the situation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-core">Core Power Words</h4>
<p>When you create your hero, you have two <strong>Core Power Words</strong> common to all members of your class. You don’t have to choose them; you get them automatically.</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-personal">Personal Power Words</h4>
<p>In addition to Core Power Words, your hero also has 6 Personal Power Words. When you create your hero, choose these 6 from your class’s list of 15 Personal Power Words. (If your class is Paragon, pick an extra one from your class, and another from any class’s list.)</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-nova">Nova Power Words</h4>
<p>Your <strong>Nova Power Powers</strong> can be anything; you’re encouraged to use your Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.</p>
<p>Like Ideals, you can choose any two words you like for your hero’s Nova Power Words.</p>
<p>Nova Power Words might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soaring Dragon</li>
<li>Berserker Rage</li>
<li>Indomitable Spirit</li>
<li>Solar Flare</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’ve checked off each of your hero’s Ideals, you unlock your <strong>Nova Power Words</strong> and can use them until the end of the current Storyline.</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-scene">Scene Power Words</h4>
<p>Each scene where a Crisis takes places has up to 6 Power Words that describe the environment around your heroes. These are known as <strong>Scene Power Words.</strong></p>
<p>The Editor comes up with Scene Power Words when describing a location, and if you think creatively, you can use them in your Power Stunts and Combos.</p>
<h3 id="toc-skills-chargen">Skills</h3>
<p>Skills define what your hero does does outside of their life as a superhero – they could be from before gaining powers, or they might be what they still do now.</p>
<p>When you create your hero, your class may give you several Skills for free; in addition, you have at least 2 free picks.</p>
<section id="facets" class="soapbox">
<h3>Facets</h3>
<p>These Facets – named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles – were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, or as wise or charming as they like.</p>
<p>The other reason for these Facets is that the concept of Intelligence as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, including racial and class injustice.</p>
<p>We chose “Detective” as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve problems by thinking about them and gathering information, not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="toc-facets">Facets</h3>
<p>Each hero’s nature is defined by their scores in 5 different facets, which represent their approaches to solving problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong> - a direct, straight-forward approach</li>
<li><strong>Adventure</strong> - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations</li>
<li><strong>Detective</strong> - a logical approach, based on gathering information</li>
<li><strong>Mystery</strong> - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions</li>
<li><strong>Suspense</strong> - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of your hero’s facets start with a score of 1, and you have 5 additional points to distribute to them.</p>
<h3 id="toc-fighting-style">Fighting Style</h3>
<p>Your hero specializes in one style of fighting, whether they attack with their fists or their powers. Those styles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acrobat</strong> Reduce by 1 the cost to avoid a Crisis move targeting only you.</li>
<li><strong>Brawler</strong> Add 3 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal.</li>
<li><strong>Controller</strong> Add 3 dice when you use a Power to advance the Outwit goal.</li>
<li><strong>Frenzy</strong> Add 3 dice when you use a Power to advance the Smash Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Interceptor</strong> Reduce by 1 the cost to Take the Hit for someone else.</li>
<li><strong>Martial Artist</strong> Add 3 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Outwit goal.</li>
<li><strong>Mediator</strong> Add 2 dice when you advance the Allay Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Rescuer</strong> Add 2 dice when you advance the Rescue Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Sniper</strong> Add 3 dice when you use a ranged Weapon to advance the Smash goal.</li>
<li><strong>Tactician</strong> Add 3 dice when you add to the Teamwork Pool.</li>
<li><strong>Weaponmaster</strong> Add 3 dice when you use a melee Weapon to advance the Outwit goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose the Knight class, you get to pick an additional fighting style.</p>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="toc-ideals">Ideals</h3>
<p>Your hero has five Ideals that drive them to feats of heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen by you when you create your hero; there’s no set list.</p>
<p>For example, one hero could have these five Ideals:</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<ul>
<li>Truth</li>
<li>Justice</li>
<li>Responsibility</li>
<li>Restraint</li>
<li>Hope</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When you use all five of your hero’s Ideals in a Storyline, your hero’s Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you unlock your Nova Power Words and can use those until the end of current Storyline.</p>
<p>When a new Storyline begins, all the marked off Ideals are cleared and it’s time to start again.</p>
<p><strong>note: need rewrite for Facet-based</strong></p>
<h4 id="random-ideals">Random Ideals</h4>
<p>If you’re stuck for ideas, you can roll roll two dice and check the following table – or just pick up to five from the list that sound good.</p>

<h3 id="toc-chargen-identity">Your Hero’s Identity</h3>
<p>“Identity” is a general term, and you can define it however you like for your hero. It could include their racial or cultural identity, their sexual or gender identity, their physical appearance, their pronouns, their disabilities (if any), their age, or any-or-all of these.</p>
<p>In addition, you can decide if your hero is a normal human; a human changed through an experiment or magic; a strange visitor from another world; an artificial life form; a time-traveler; or anything else you can imagine.</p>
<p><em>Most</em> heroes will go by two names – one being their personal, non-superhero name and the other being their superhero code-name.</p>
<p>It’s up to you if everyone knows your hero by both names, or if one is a <em>Secret Identity</em> only shared with a few.</p>
<p>You can also decide if your hero has the same general characteristics in all identities, or if they change from identity to the next: are they taller or shorter in their secret ID? Do they have the same gender in each identity?</p>
<p>Use your imagination, and don’t be afraid to bounce ideas off your fellow players and the Editor if you get stuck.</p>
<h3 id="toc-storyline">Initial Storyline</h3>
<p>A <strong>Storyline</strong> is one or more connected Issues focusing on one hero, known as the <strong>Spotlight</strong> hero. At a climactic part of the Storyline, the Spotlight hero has an <strong>Opportunity</strong> to change – the chance to evaluate their assumptions and decisions, and react accordingly.</p>
<p>Once in each Volume, your hero gets to play through one Storyline where they have the Spotlight. You get to define what their <em>Opportunity</em> will be – it could be an important lesson they get to learn, or a piece of information about their origin they’d never known, or an experience you think will force them to make a difficult moral decision.</p>
<p>There are five rules for creating an Opportunity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Your Hero is the <em>Star</em></strong> - An Opportunity can’t be focused on a group decision or a side character’s experiences, except for how that affects your hero.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You <em>Want</em> to Play Through It</strong> - The Editor will plan Crises based on the assumption that if you ask for an Opportunity, it represents something you actually want to have happen to your hero in the game. If you <em>aren’t</em> interested in it, then don’t ask for it!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change is Never <em>Easy</em></strong> - This means that you should expect that any Opportunity you create represents something that your hero can’t just easily dismiss or shrug off. If you say you want an Opportunity of being asked to join a villain team, then that should represent an actual struggle for your hero.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change is <em>Not</em> Required</strong> - An Opportunity is just that: the <em>chance</em> for a change. But it’s completely valid for your hero to come to that Opportunity and decide they <em>aren’t</em> going to change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Play to Find Out</strong> - Don’t pick the outcome, just the Opportunity! In other words, <em>don’t</em> come up with both the Opportunity <em>and</em> the result of the Storyline; be open to seeing where the questions will take your hero and let yourself be surprised through the act of playing the game.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When you create your hero, choose one Opportunity based on these five rules; you can ask the Editor and your fellow players for advice as well.</p>
<p>At the end of any Storyline where your hero is <em>not</em> the Spotlight hero, you have option of changing your Opportunity – for exmaple, if you come up with a better idea during another her’s Spotlight.</p>
<h4 id="opportunity-examples">Opportunity Examples</h4>
<p>These are examples of the types of Opportunities you can create.</p>

<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their civilian life – from their secret identity, their profession before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training.</p>
<p>The Skills are:</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<ul>
<li>Academic</li>
<li>Artist</li>

<li>Spy</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as determined by your class, which may also give additional skills.</p>
<h3 id="using-skills">Using Skills</h3>
<p>When you make a roll that could be affected by one of your Skills, you add a number of dice to the dice pool equal to the current Volume.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a Skill, you don’t add any extra dice to the pool.</p>
<h3 id="skill-descriptions">Skill Descriptions</h3>
<p>The skills in <span class="gamename"></span> are listed below, along with 3 to 5 suggestions how you could use the skill with your hero’s Facets and consequences the Editor can propose on an Edge Success.</p>

<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-power-use">Using Powers</h2>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-power-displays">Power Displays</h3>
<p>When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word and explain how you’re using that power.</p>
<p>A Power Display doesn’t cost any Might points.</p>
<p>Power Displays don’t have a game-mechanics effect on your rolls, but you can use them to explain how you’re able to <em>make</em> those rolls.</p>
<p>For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to the skies to throw a punch.</p>
<p>If you don’t have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.</p>
<h3 id="toc-power-stunts">Power Stunts</h3>
<p>A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together, and unlike a Power Display, a Stunt will affect the result of your next roll. In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.</p>
<p>When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you’re hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory effects.</p>
<p>After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an appropriate roll for your Power Stunt – either to increase the Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an additional die to the dice pool for each Power Word beyond the first.</p>
<p>You don’t have to come up with Power Stunts beforehand; instead, you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.</p>
<p>For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase “Flight Speed”. Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt means that when you make a roll – such as rolling your Adventure Facet to Outwit a foe – increases the number of dice in your pool by 1 die.</p>
<h3 id="toc-power-combos">Power Combos</h3>
<p>A <strong>Power Combo</strong> is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work together, with their powers combined.</p>
<p>To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they’d like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you’re trying to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.</p>
<p>You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long as you can come up with an explanation of how they’re helping.</p>
<p>The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, and they’re called the initiating hero for that Combo.</p>
<p>A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt – the player of the initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them, spending 1 point of Might and increasing the number of dice of their next roll by 1 Success.</p>
<p>The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which adds a die to the dice pool.</p>
<p>Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one of their Core Power Words as a <em>third</em> (or fourth) Power Word in the Combo.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>

<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-power-use-core">Using Core Power Words</h3>
<p>You can use one of your Core Power Words as a <em>third</em> Power Word in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, and adds another 1 die to the dice pool on your roll.</p>
<p>By spending yet 1 <em>more</em> Might point you can add your <em>other</em> Core Power Word as a <em>fourth</em> Power Word in a Power Stunt. Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 dice in the dice pool, but also costs you 3 Might points.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-power-use-nova">Using Nova Power Words</h3>
<p>Once you’ve checked all of your hero’s Ideals, you unlock your <strong>Nova Power Words</strong> and can use them until the end of the current Storyline.</p>
<p>You can use one of your Nova Power Words as the <em>second</em> Power Word in a Stunt without spending any Might; likewise, you can add use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the Nova Power Word still increases the roll’s dice pool by 1 die.</p>
<p>Using your <em>other</em> Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or Power Combo requires spending 1 Might.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-power-use-scene">Scene Power Words</h3>
<p>Each scene has up to 6 Scene Power Words, chosen by the Editor.</p>
<p>You can use one Scene Power Word as a second Power Word in a Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, but they still contribute 1 die to the dice pool.</p>
<p>Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, and it likewise increases the dice pool of that Combo.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-crisis">Crisis</h2>
<p>Any encounter requiring your hero’s unique superheroic talents and powers is known as a <strong>Crisis.</strong> A Crisis could be anything from a natural disaster to a runaway train; from a group of normal criminals to one or more super-powered villains.</p>
<p>There isn’t a separate game system for combats and fights; those use the same system as any other Crisis.</p>
<p>Each Crisis is rated in three <strong>Goals</strong> that describe how the heroes could tackle that Crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smash</strong> - defeating the Crisis through physical damage</li>
<li><strong>Outwit</strong> - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis</li>
<li><strong>Withstand</strong> - outlast the Crisis by taking all it can throw at you</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="toc-crisis-countdown">Countdown to Crisis</h3>
<p>A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need to present at the start of a Crisis.</p>
<p>The steps to take before a Crisis are:</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Set the Scene</li>
<li>Determine who is Present</li>
<li>Define the Goals</li>
<li>Assemble the Teamwork Pool</li>
<li>The Crisis begins!</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="toc-crisis-present">Determining Who is Present</h4>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h5 class="colbefore" id="innocent-bystanders">Innocent Bystanders</h5>
<p>Superhero fights can be dangerous for people caught in the crossfire, and most natural or manmade disasters place people in danger.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Crisis, the Editor can assign points to the Bystander Pool. Heroes can use the Save Innocents move to reduce the size of the Bystander Pool, while the Crisis’s moves can be used to increase it.</p>
<p>When the Bystander Pool is reduced to zero, there are no longer any endangered people, although in subsequent turns, the Crisis may add more to this pool.</p>
<p>This table is a rough guideline for how many people are endangered and how large the Bystander Pool should be:</p>

<p>When a hero reduces the size of the Bystander Pool with the Save Innocents move, they regain a number of Might points equal to the number of points removed. Protecting others reinvigorates the heroes to fight on.</p>
<p>If a Crisis move reduces the size of the Bystander Pool, the same amount is <em>also</em> subtracted from the Teamwork Pool. Being unable to save everyone is demoralizing to all heroes.</p>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-goals">Defining the Goals</h4>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-pool">Assembling the Teamwork Pool</h4>
<p>When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving a Crisis.</p>
<p>If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using a Facet related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for their heroes.</p>
<p>If your hero is <em>not</em> on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it’s being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.</p>
<p>Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, it’s time to start.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-start">Starting a Crisis</h3>
<p>Instead of having an initiative order like many games of this type, there are two phases that alternate back and forth: the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase.</p>
<p>The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is the Hero Phase.</p>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="toc-crisis-hero">Hero Phase</h3>
<p>The heroes can each take one move during the Hero Phase, one at a time, in any order they like.</p>
<p>While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially three things you can choose to do: Advance a Goal, Contribute to the Teamwork Pool, or Save Innocents.</p>
<p>If your hero is <em>not</em> present, you can use the Timely Arrival move.</p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-timely">Timely Arrival</h4>
<p>When you use the Timely Arrival move, spend 5 successes from the Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current Hero Phase.</p>
<p>You can’t make any other moves that turn, but you <em>can</em> describe your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<p>The cost of the Timely Arrival move decreases by 1 success every Crisis Phase.</p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-alert">General Alert</h4>
<p>If two or more heroes aren’t present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at the scene can use their turn to sound a General Alert and call for help. The cost of a General Alert is 1 success per hero called.</p>
<p>The heroes arrive at the start of the <em>next</em> Hero Phase, and can act normally during that turn. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike a Timely Arrival, they don’t roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-advance">Advance a Goal</h4>
<p>When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the Crisis. There are three different ways of doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smash</strong> - defeating the Crisis through physical damage</li>
<li><strong>Outwit</strong> - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis</li>
<li><strong>Allay</strong> - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis</li>
<li><strong>Rescue</strong> - rescue people or property endangered by the Crisis</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to advance it once. You don’t need to roll all these successes at once; you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too.</p>
<p>Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, the Crisis ends. The players have successfully Smashed, Outwitted, or Withstood the danger.</p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-contribute">Contribute to the Teamwork Pool</h4>
<p>When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything you can think of that might give your team an edge.</p>
<p>You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes.</p>
<p>When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness to the Teamwork Pool.</p>

<p>Once every hero has taken a move, then it’s time for the Editor to take their turn.</p>
<p>Every Crisis has a set number of moves per turn. As a rule, the more moves a Crisis gets per turn, the more difficult it is. If the Crisis has the same number of moves as the hero team, it will be very challenging.</p>
<p>The Editor chooses moves from the Encounter’s list of moves. Every move has a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes from the Teamwork Pool, they defend against that move and nothing happens.</p>
<p>If there aren’t enough successes in the pool to defend against the move, or if the heroes decide not to counter the move, then the move happens and the heroes face the consequences.</p>
<p>Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting the heroes’ ability to use a certain type of roll or move on their next turn, or innocents being endangered.</p>
<p>Once the Editor has taken enough moves, it’s time to go back to the heroes.</p>
