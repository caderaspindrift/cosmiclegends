# From Issues to Volumes {#toc-issues .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} uses some terms from comic books to talk about how 
the game is played.

## Issues

Each individual game session is known as an **Issue**, and roughly
corresponds to one issue of a comic book.

The **First Issue** is the first session of an ongoing []{.gamename}
played by a group. 

### Issue 0

**Issue 0** -- known as *Session 0* in other games -- is an
Issue of a []{.gamename} Series when the players don't roll dice and 
handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person
is looking forward to playing.

The Issue 0 takes place before the First Issue, and should go over the 
safety tools used in the game, stress the importance of open communication, 
and set expectations on the kind of story and play.

Issue 0s are also a great time to create heroes together as a group,
rather than separately.

### One-Shots

A **One-Shot** is an Issue that isn't part of a Story Arc, Volume, or
Series, but stands alone. Most games played at conventions, for example,
will be One-Shots.

One-Shots obviously won't have a separate Issue 0, but time should still
be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on these important aspects
of []{.gamename}.

Many First Issues are One-Shots, as the players and Editor are still 
getting to know their heroes and the game. These First Issues usually
feature a few simple Crises to resolve.

## Storylines

During an Issue, the Editor and the players play out the events of
a **Storyline**.

When you create a new hero, you define a specific lesson you'd like 
your hero to learn or a specific experience you'd like them to have.
For that Storyline, your character is considered the **Spotlight** hero.

Each Storyline consists of:

- the Spotlight hero
- the Lesson
- one or more Crises connected to the Lesson, introduced by the Editor
- the heroes' reactions to each Crisis
- the Spotlight hero's reaction the Lesson

Many Storylines will resolve over the course of one Issue, but some
can take long and might run for 2 or 3 sessions, or longer.

Once your hero finishes your Storyline, both your hero and your 
fellow players' heroes gain an **Advancement.**

## Volumes

Each Storyline is part of a **Volume**; Volumes are a grouping of
Issues -- game sessions -- and are numbered starting with 1.  

Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Storylines, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue, known as an **Annual**. 

The Annual ties together the events of the previous Storylines in the
Volume, and then that Volume concludes.

At the start of a new Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.

## Series

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a **Series,** and each 
Series is comprised of up to five Volumes. 

## Guest Stars and Crossovers

A **Guest Star** is a hero character from another Series -- either played
by the same group or a different one -- who plays in the Series for an
Issue or two.

A **Crossover** happens when the heroes from two or more Series work
together, usually in large, wide-ranging One-Shots.
