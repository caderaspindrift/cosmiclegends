# Issues, Story Arcs, Series, and Volumes {#toc-issues}

An adventure in []{.gamename} is known as a Story. A Story
consists of one or more Crises introduced by the Editor, and
the heroes' reactions to those challenges.

Each individual game session is known as an Issue. 
Most Stories will resolve over one Issue, but some can take longer.

When you create a new hero, you define a Story Arc that describes 
a specific lesson you'd like them to learn or a specific experience 
you'd like them to have.  Once your hero finishes your Story Arc, 
both your hero and your fellow players' heroes gain an Advancement.

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a Series, 
and each Series is comprised of up to five Volumes, beginning
with Volume 1.

Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Story Arcs, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue that ties together 
the previous Story Arcs, and that Volume ends.

At the end of a Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.
