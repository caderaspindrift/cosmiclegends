# From Issues to Volumes {#toc-issues .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} uses some terms from comic books to talk about how 
the game is played.

## Issues

::::::::: struct :::::::::::
<div class="issue wide">
  <div class="recap wide"></div>
  <div class="crisis wide"></div>
  <div class="vignette wide"></div>
  <div class="crisis wide"></div>
  <div class="vignette wide"></div>
  <div class="lettercol wide">
   <div class="bleed wide"></div>
   <div class="stars_wishes wide"></div>
  </div>
</div>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Each individual game session is known as an **Issue**, and roughly
corresponds to one issue of a comic book.

::::::::: struct :::::::::::
<div class="issue first wide">
  <div class="recap wide"></div>
  <div class="vignette"></div>
  <div class="vignette"></div>
  <div class="vignette"></div>
  <div class="vignette"></div>
  <div class="crisis extra wide"></div>
  <div class="lettercol wide">
  </div>
</div>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The **First Issue** is the first played session of an ongoing []{.gamename} 
campaigned played by a group -- but first you should have an Issue 0.

### Issue 0

::::::::::: struct ::::::::::::
<div class="issue wide zero">
  <div class="do_chargen wide"></div>
  <div class="lines_veils wide"></div>
  <div class="comics_code wide"></div>
</div>
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Issue 0** -- known as *Session 0* in other games -- is an
Issue of a []{.gamename} Series when the players don't roll dice and 
handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person
is looking forward to playing.

Issue 0 takes place before the First Issue, and should go over the 
safety tools used in the game, stress the importance of open communication, 
and set expectations on the kind of story and play.

Issue 0s are also a great time to create heroes together as a group,
rather than separately.

## Storylines

:::::::::::: struct :::::::::::::::::::
<div class="storyline wide">
  <div class="issue wide"></div>
</div>
<div class="storyline wide">
  <div class="issue"></div>
  <div class="issue"></div>
  <div class="issue"></div>
  <div class="issue"></div>
</div>
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

During an Issue, the Editor and the players play out the events of
a **Storyline**.

When you create a new hero, you define a specific lesson you'd like 
your hero to learn or a specific experience you'd like them to have.
For that Storyline, your character is considered the **Spotlight** hero.

Each Storyline consists of:

- the Spotlight hero
- the Opportunity
- one or more Crises connected to the Opportunity, introduced by the Editor
- the heroes' reactions to each Crisis
- the Spotlight hero's reaction the Opportunity

Many Storylines will resolve over the course of one Issue, but some
can take long and might run for 2 or 3 sessions, or longer.

Once your hero finishes your Storyline, both your hero and your 
fellow players' heroes gain an **Advancement.**

### One-Shots

A **One-Shot** is an Issue that isn't part of a Storyline, Volume, or
Series, but stands alone. Most games played at conventions, for example,
will be One-Shots.

Sometimes a One-Shot doesn't have a Spotlight hero, meaning there's no
Opportunity either, but just a connected series of Crises. In those 
cases, all heroes receive a standard Advancements after dealing with 
the Crises.

One-Shots obviously won't have a separate Issue 0, but time should still
be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on important safety tools.

Many First Issues are One-Shots, as the players and Editor are still 
getting to know their heroes and the game. These First Issues usually
feature a few simple Crises to resolve.

## Volumes

::::::::::::: struct :::::::::::
<div class="volume wide extra ">
  <div class="storyline wide"></div>
  <div class="storyline wide"></div>
  <div class="storyline wide"></div>
  <div class="issue annual wide"></div>
</div>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Each Storyline is part of a **Volume**; Volumes are a grouping of
Issues -- game sessions -- and are numbered starting with 1.  

::::::::::::: struct :::::::::::
<div class="issue annual wide">
 <div class="recap wide"></div>
 <div class="crisis extra wide"></div>
 <div class="vignette"></div>
 <div class="vignette"></div>
 <div class="vignette"></div>
 <div class="vignette"></div>
 <div class="lettercol wide"></div>
</div>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Storylines, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue, known as an **Annual**. 

The Annual ties together the events of the previous Storylines in the
Volume, and then that Volume concludes.

At the start of a new Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.

## Series

:::::::::::::: struct :::::::::::
<div class="series wide">
  <div class="issue wide zero"></div>
  <div class="volume one extra wide"></div>
  <div class="volume two extra wide"></div>
  <div class="volume three extra wide"></div>
  <div class="volume four extra wide"></div>
  <div class="volume five extra wide"></div>
</div>
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a **Series,** and each 
Series is comprised of up to five Volumes. 

If your group reaches the end of Volume 5 and with to continue with
with the same heroes, you can do so: just treat later Volumes as having
a Volume number of 5, and proceed from there.

## Guest Stars and Crossovers

A **Guest Star** is a hero character from another Series -- either played
by the same group or a different one -- who plays in the Series for an
Issue or two. If the Guest Star's Volume number is higher than the group's,
temporarily lower the Guest Star to the same Volume.

A **Crossover** happens when the heroes from two or more Series work
together, usually in large, wide-ranging One-Shots. All participating 
heroes keep their normal Volume numbers without adjustment.
