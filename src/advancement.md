# Advancements {#toc-advancements .breakbefore}

Advancements are how you reflect your hero's growth over the
course of a Volume and Series.

After each Storyline concludes, choose one Advancement from the following list:

- Increase your Health by 1.
- Increase your Might by 1.
- Add one Skill; you can only choose this Advancement once per volume.
- Add one Power Word from any class; you can only choose this Advancement once per volume.
- Add one Fighting Style; you can only choose this Advancement once per volume.

## Spotlight Hero

If you had the Spotlight for that Storyline, increase any one Approach 
by 1. This is in addition to the normal Advancement for the end of a
Storyline.

## Changes

Optionally, you could can make any or all of these changes to your hero:

- Change one of your Ideals to any other word.
- Change your Opportunity if you haven't already completed your Storyline.

## Volume Advancements

At the end of each Volume:

- Pick a new Class ability from the new Volume or a previous Volume.
- Create a new Opportunity for the new Volume.

### Changes

In additional, you can choose one or more of the following changes to your hero:

- Switch one of your Personal Power Words for another from your class.
- Switch your Fighting Style to any other Fighting Style.
- Switch one of your Skill choices for another Skill.
- Change your Nova Words to any other two words.
- Choose a new Costume, Symbol, or Hero Name.

## Experienced Heroes

If you're creating a new hero for an ongoing Series, you don't
start at Volume One -- instead, your hero starts at the same Volume as
everyone else.

### Class Abilities

You start with the Class Ability from your class, and one Class
Ability per Volume, of that Volume or lower.

### Advancements

You get a number of Advancements equal to the number of other Heroes
for each previous Volume. You can't add more Skills, Personal Power
Words, or Fighting Styles than the number of completed Volumes.
