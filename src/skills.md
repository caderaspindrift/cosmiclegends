::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as
determined by your class, which may also give additional skills.

## Using Skills

When you make a roll that could be affected by one of your Skills,
you add a number of dice to the dice pool equal to the current Volume.

If you don't have a Skill, you don't add any extra dice to the pool.

## Skill Descriptions

The skills in []{.gamename} are listed below, along with 3 to 5 
suggestions how you could use the skill with your hero's Approaches
and consequences the Editor can propose on an Edge Success.
