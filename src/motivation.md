# Motivations {#toc-motivation}

Your hero has five Motivations that drive them to feats of 
heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen
by you when you create your hero; there's no set list.

For example, one hero could have these five Motivations:

- Truth
- Justice
- Responsibility
- Restraint
- Hope

When you use all five of your hero's Motivations in a Story Arc, 
your hero's Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you
unlock your Nova Power Words and can use those until the
end of current Story Arc.

When a new Story Arc begins, all the marked off Motivations are 
cleared and itâ€™s time to start again.
