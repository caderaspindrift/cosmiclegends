# Crisis {#toc-crisis .breakbefore}

Any encounter requiring your hero's unique superheroic talents and 
powers is known as a **Crisis.**
A Crisis could be anything from a natural disaster to a runaway
train; from a group of normal criminals to one or more super-powered
villains.

There isn't a separate game system for combats and fights; those use
the same system as any other Crisis.

Each Crisis is rated in three **Goals** that describe how the heroes 
could tackle that Crisis:

- **Smash** - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Withstand** - outlast the Crisis by taking all it can throw at you

## Countdown to Crisis {#toc-crisis-countdown .colbefore}

A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem
and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a
location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need 
to present at the start of a Crisis.

The steps to take before a Crisis are:

5. Set the Scene
4. Determine who is Present
3. Define the Goals
2. Assemble the Teamwork Pool
1. The Crisis begins!

### Setting the Scene {#toc-crisis-scene}

[]{.lorem}

### Determining Who is Present {#toc-crisis-present}

[]{.lorem}

### Defining the Goals {#toc-crisis-goals}

[]{.lorem}

### Assembling the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-pool}

When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the 
initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of 
describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving
a Crisis. 

If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero
reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using
a Facet related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to
the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for
their heroes.

If your hero is *not* on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it's
being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend
from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.

Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, it’s time to start.

## Starting a Crisis {#toc-crisis-start}

Instead of having an initiative order like many games of this type, 
there are two phases that alternate back and forth: 
the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase. 

The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is 
the Hero Phase.

## Hero Phase {#toc-crisis-hero .colbefore}

The heroes can each take one action during the Hero Phase, one at a time, 
in any order they like.

While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially three
things you can choose to do: Advance a Goal, Contribute to the Teamwork Pool,
or Save Innocents.

If your hero is *not* present, you can use the Timely Arrival action.

### Timely Arrival {#toc-crisis-timely}

When you use the Timely Arrival action, spend 5 successes from the
Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current Hero Phase. 

You can't take any other actions that turn, but you *can* describe 
your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. 
Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.

The cost of the Timely Arrival action decreases by 1 success every
Crisis Phase.

### General Alert {#toc-crisis-alert}

If two or more heroes aren't present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at 
the scene can use their turn to sound a General Alert and call for help.
The cost of a General Alert is 1 success per hero called.

The heroes arrive at the start of the *next* Hero Phase, and can act
normally during that turn. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike
a Timely Arrival, they don't roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.

### Advance a Goal {#toc-crisis-advance}

When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the 
Crisis. There are three different ways of doing this:

- **Smash** - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Withstand** - outlast the Crisis, taking all it can throw at you

The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to 
advance it once. You don’t need to roll all these successes at once; 
you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too. 

Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, the Crisis ends.
The players have successfully Smashed, Outwitted, or Withstood the danger.

### Contribute to the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-contribute}

When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions 
that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything 
you can think of that might give your team an edge. 

You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, 
or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes. 

When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness
to the Teamwork Pool.

### Saving Innocents {#toc-crisis-saving}

## Crisis Phase {#toc-crisis-crisis .colbefore}

Once every hero has taken an action, then it’s time for the Editor
to take their turn.

Every Crisis has a set number of turns per round. As a rule, the more 
actions a Crisis gets per turn, the more difficult it is. 
If the Crisis has the same number of actions as the hero team,
it will be very challenging.

The Editor chooses actions from the Encounter’s list. Every action has 
a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes from the 
Teamwork Pool, they defend against the attack and nothing happens.

For every action the Crisis tries to take, the heroes have an opportunity 
to spend successes from the Teamwork Pool to defend. If there aren’t 
enough successes in the pool to defend, or if the heroes decide not to defend, 
then the action happens and the heroes face the consequences. 

Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting 
the heroes' ability to use a certain type of roll on their next turn,
or innocents being endangered.

Once the Editor has taken enough actions, it’s time to go back to the heroes.
