- history: |
    For most Earthlings, Obsidius was the first Vulcanor they'd ever
    heard of; the inhabitants of the Volcano Isles kept themselves 
    isolated for centuries from the primative outside world.
    
    The oldest child of King Tachylus and Queen Limuo, Obsidius was raised
    to be the heir to the advanced Vulcanor civilization. From an early
    age, he trained with weapons and studied statecraft and the sciences.
    
    While just a young man, Tachylus sent Obsidius as an emissary, first
    to meet Titan and then to the outside world in general. Shortly after
    the Cosmic Legends were created, he joined as their first non-founding
    member.
    
    Obsidius's recklessness as a young man led to several diplomatic
    incidents with the outside world, including a tense but brief cold
    war with New Zealand.
    
    The ensuing decades have mellowed the crown prince's temper, and he's
    regarded as an elder statesman in the superhero community -- to his
    amusement, as 75 years of age is still considered young by Vulcanor
    standards.
    
    King Tachylus, on the other hand, is no longer a young monarch and is
    showing his age. Obsidius's mother, Limuo, has renounced her title
    and separated from Tachylus, while their younger child, Igneia, was
    exiled for attempting to murder the rest of the Royal Family.
    
    These have put additional stresses on Obsidius to find a spouse and
    produce a future successor, if just to prevent Vulcanor from 
    descending into a civil war between his many squabbling cousins were
    something to happen to the king and prince.
- powers: |
    Like all Vulcanors, Obsidius is superhumanly strong, able to lift several tons
    and resist small-arms fire with his stony skin. He's also completely impervious
    to heat of any kind.
    
    Obsidius's rank as the Crown Prince gives him limited control over rock and earth, 
    although he has done little to actively develop those abilities.
- weapons: |
    Obsidius Rex's primary weapon is the Lavablade, a greatsword formed
    of volcanic steel. In the past he has wielded the Ring of Fire as his 
    symbol of rank, but it was destroyed by the Man in Black in 2003.
