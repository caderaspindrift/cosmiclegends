- history: |

    Kelly Liang always loved the sea; while a high school
    student in Hawai'i she took a job as a lifeguard, even
    though her family was wealthy enough that she didn't
    *need* to work.
    
    While working that very job, Kelly was stung by a mutated
    jellyfish in the process of saving a drowning woman. 
    She managed to make it safely back to shore before from 
    the strange toxins in her blood.
    
    Kelly lay in a coma for three weeks, while her parents
    saw that she received the best care that money could buy --
    including an experimental treatment that brought her
    back to consciousness.
    
    Although she was awake, the experience had left her weakened
    and barely able to move. Giving up her beloved surfing
    hobby, Kelly threw herself into the study of biochemistry
    and marine biology, eventually becoming a professor.
    
    Years after her life-changing accident, Kelly managed to
    a synthesize a cure for the poisons that ravaged her body --
    and also found a strange side effect had given her control
    over water!
    
    Dubbing herself Riptide, Liang became a superhero and eventually
    was invited to join the Cosmic Legends. She still teaches 
    marine biology at the university; Kelly's identity as Riptide is 
    an open secret among most Hawai'ians.
    
    But as Riptide is the most prominent and popular superhero 
    of Hawai'i, the people of the islands are happy to maintain 
    the polite fiction that there's no connection between Professor
    Liang and the Hero of Hilo.
- powers: |
    Riptide has complete telekinetic control over liquid water, 
    with limited control over ice and water vapor. She can condense
    atmospheric water to liquid form, and can instantly melt or
    evaporate solid ice.
    
    She can propel herself at speeds up to 100 m.p.h. underwater
    or on the surface of a body of water, and 50 m.p.h. over land.
