      short black hair and brown eyes. As \*\*Energy Boy\*\*, he looks like a

- history: |
    Del Thompson grew up in the shadow of brilliance -- his mother and namesake,
    Delphine Thompson, was one of the most gifted physicists of her generation.
    
    Unfortunately, her genius led her to take dangerous risks, including going
    online with an experimental cold fusion reactor before all the appropriate
    safeties were online. "You only need those when things go wrong," Delphine
    explained to her son, then ten years old. "And I never get things wrong."
    
    As fate would have it ... that was the time that Thompson's hubris was proven
    a false vanity. The reactor raged out of control as dangerous energies washed
    over her laboratory and the rest of Technopolis.
    
    With Delphine unconscious and dying from radiation poisoning, only quick 
    thinking by Del managed to halt the out-of-control reaction -- at the cost
    of his life. The young boy was completely disintegrated.
    
    Or so everyone believed. Over the next few weeks, Del reformed his body
    from pure nuclear energy. He regained consciousness to find his
    mother had survived -- but had likewise been changed by the overloaded
    reactor. Calling herself Neutrino, she fled police custody and soon joined
    the newly-forming Villains, Inc.

    Del was taken in by his mother's former lab partner, Hazel Montgomery,
    the original Vespa. Together with Montgomery's child Lin -- the sidekick
    hero Bug -- Del became one of the first two students at Technopolis Academy 
    and a founding member of the Junior Legends of America.

    Del's natural state of being is a humanoid form composed of supercharged plasma.
    He can use this energy as destructive blasts, as an energy-backed "nuke punch!", 
    and as a force bubble to absorb energy.
    
    With concentration -- and as a result of years of practice -- he can dampen
    his nuclear energies and assume a human shape, becoming the young man he would
    have been had his mother's pride not cost them both dearly.
