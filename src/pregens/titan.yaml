    "Titan is widely acknowledged as the first public superhero and one
    of the primary leaders among the heroes.
    
    Ty'Tonn To'Rezz's story begins on Jarnsaxa, one of the smaller, outer moons
    of Saturn. There, Ty'Tonn and his spouses manned the massive telescopes and
    monitoring systems created by the Sentinels of Saturn.
    
    When the remote sensory devices detected the approach of a Visitor fleet,
    Ty'Tonn was chosen to travel to *L'Shar'Ak*, capital of Titan, and present 
    their findings to *Kyl'Sh'Tal* command.
    
    According to the course computed by My'Tonn, Ty's sibling, the Visitors would
    pass by just the outermost moons of Saturn and instead were on a direct path
    for *W'Ty'Dah'k*, the third planet from the sun: Earth.
    
    Fearing the harm the Visitors could do to the primitive, just-barely-nuclear
    civilizations of *W'Ty'Dah'k*, Ty'Tonn urged the *Kyl'Sh'Tal* to intervene.
    \"Are we not the Sentinels for the entire solar system?\", Ty argued; \"Should we
    not be concerned with the fate of all who are threatened by the Visitors?\"
    
    The *Kyl'Sh'Tal* council debated for many hours but it soon became clear that
    they prioritized the survival of Titanian civilization over that of 
    *W'Ty'Dah'k* -- and even considered the potentially massive loss of human
    life to a net benefit to the people of Titan.
    
    Outraged by their actions, Ty'Tonn returned to Jarnsaxa and plotted sedition
    within in their spousal cluster. Ty' would head to *W'Ty'Dah'k* first, to be
    followed by the rest of the cluster once contact had been established with the
    Earthings.
    
    Ty'Tonn To'Rezz arrived on Earth in October 1956 and made contact with 
    the Americans' Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats
    (A.L.E.R.T.). Becoming known on Earth as *Titan*, Ty'Tonn worked with
    A.L.E.R.T., Marquis Malign, Vespa and Obsidius to drive back the initial
    wave of Visitor landing craft and break their invasion.
    
    Scorned by the other *Kyl'Sh'Tal* for disobedience, Ty'Tonn To'Rezz returned to 
    family on Jarnsaxa, only to find that the monitoring outpost had been destroyed 
    by retreating Visitor craft when the station's cloaking screens failed under 
    mysterious circumstances.
    
    Following that tragedy, Ty'Tonn relocated permanently to the planet Earth,
    despite the sweltering heat, and went on to help found the Cosmic Legends of
    the Universe in September 1963. For while he used the name \"Tom Torres\" but has
    since discontinued the use of an alternate identity. Since the start of the 21st
    century, he has lived in Nova Scotia and has been granted honorary Canadian
    citizenship."

    "Titan is perhaps the most powerful individual on the planet.
    His Titanian strength lets him lift well over 100 tons, and he is
    able to project the cold frost of the Titanian sky from his
    eyes as energy beams. Flight, speed, and telepathy round out his
    vast array of alien powers -- which are exceptional even for a
    Titanian."
