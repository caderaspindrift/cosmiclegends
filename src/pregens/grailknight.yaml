- history: |
    Percival Pellinore, the Grailknight, is *the* Percival of myth -- member
    of Arthur's Round Table, son of Pellinore, questing knight of the Holy Grail.
    
    Although Percival is reluctant to speak of his past, he has told a few that
    he swore an oath to find and recover the Chalice of the Last Supper, and
    that he would never rest until he had fulfilled said oath.
    
    Either his unflagging devotion to his vow or the divine nature of his mission
    have kept him alive, and no older than middle aged, for centuries. Percival's
    legend weaves in and out of history -- surfacing in one war only to disappear
    for a century after it and reappearing around the world.
    
    In 1963, over 50 years since his last appearance, Percival joined with other
    heroes of the time to repell Xana Mega's Fomorian invasion. Percival's offhand
    mention of the Table Round led to the formation of these heroes as a team,
    the Cosmic Legends of the Universe.
    
    With a tendency to vanish for weeks or years at a time, Percival is at best
    a part-time member of the Cosmic Legends, although whenever evil is ascendent, 
    he is an implaccable foe and resourceful ally.
- powers: |
    Sir Percival has only one confirmed power:
    immortality. Due to his vows, he's unable to die until he
    completes his quest and finds the Grail.
- weapons: |
    Although Percival is familiar with modern weaponry, he prefers to use a crossbow
    with specially prepared bolts that range from explosive tips to stun charges.
    
    His chainmail is a gift from the Aos SÃ­ and is completely unbreakable, while his
    sword, Sequence, is a sister blade to Excalibur from Arthur's arsenal.
