- history: >
    The people of Vulcanor are an offshoot of humanity that was
    experimented on by the Visitors over 3,000 years ago; their
    skin was hardened to a shiny gloss and they were adapted to
    live in volcanic conditions. Slaying their Visitor enslavers
    and stealing a shuttle craft, they settled on an otherwise
    uninhabitable remote chain of islands in the south Pacific.
    
    That distance allowed the Vulcanors time to disassemble and
    reverse-engineer many Visitor technologies, including a
    compass-scrambling magnetic field that cloaked their islands
    from the European colonialist powers.
    
    With the arrival of Titan on Earth in 1956, King Tachylus 
    decreed it was time to join the rest of the world and share --
    in limited amounts -- their unique technologies. His son
    Obsidius was sent as an emissary and later joined the
    Cosmic Legends of the Universe.
    
    Excessive heat and volcanic gasses prevent the Vulcanor 
    Islands from becoming a vacation destination. While outsiders
    are welcomed and treated with respect, few non-Vulcanors have 
    been Volcano City.
