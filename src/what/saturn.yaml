- history: |
    "The people of Saturn's moon Titan are not native to the
    Solar System; according to their oldest tales, they were
    taken from their home planet by a civilization known as
    the Visitors, were subjected to scientific experiments, 
    and were eventually abandoned on Titan.
    
    Titanians -- known as *Ro'Tan'Okk* in their own language --
    have strong mental powers and communicate by telepathy as
    often as they use *Ro'Tan'Kesh*, their spoken language.
    
    They are physically superior to humans, with most able to 
    lift over 50 tons with minimal effort. Their only weakness 
    is a strong reaction to being touched by salt water, which 
    burns them and drains their energy.
    
    There are four known genders among the Titanians; Earthlings
    are primarily familiar with the *nyrr-t'vor* gender thanks to
    the presence of Ty'Tonn To'Rezz on Earth. Titanian families
    are comprised of 3 or more spouses and their children.
    
    The *Ro'Tan'Okk* have no concepts of war or crime; the
    closest thing to a military in Titanian society is the
    *Kyl'Sh'Tal* -- the famed Sentinels of Saturn. Sentinels
    are astronomers tasked with constant vigilance -- to watch
    the skies for the return of the Visitors."
