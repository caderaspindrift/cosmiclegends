    The Fictiverse is the name given to an alternate Earth discovered
    by the Cosmic Legends in September of 1961.
    <!-- date corresponds with "Flash of Two Worlds" -->

    Fictives -- as residents of the Fictiverse are known -- include such
    famous characters as Count Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the
    Three Musketeers, and Tarzan.

    (In general, if you want to use public-domain characters in the
    world of the *Cosmic Legends*, this is where to put them. It could
    also serve as the home world of a Fictive hero who has come to
    the Cosmic Legends Universe -- in case someone wants to be Literally
    Sherlock Holmes, for example. Most Fictives would have the
    Expert hero class.)
