# Crisis {#toc-crisis .breakbefore}

Any encounter requiring your hero's unique superheroic talents and 
powers is known as a **Crisis.**
A Crisis could be anything from a natural disaster to a runaway
train; from a group of normal criminals to one or more super-powered
villains.

There isn't a separate game system for combats and fights; those use
the same system as any other Crisis.

Each Crisis is rated in four **Goals** that describe how the heroes 
could tackle that Crisis:

- **Smash**  - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Allay**  - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis
- **Rescue** - save people or property endangered by the Crisis
