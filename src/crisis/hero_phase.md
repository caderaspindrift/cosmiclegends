# Hero Phase {#toc-crisis-hero }

The heroes can each take one move during the Hero Phase, one at a time, 
in any order they like.

While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially two
types of move you can make: Advance a Goal or Contribute to the Teamwork Pool.

If your hero is *not* present, you can use the Timely Arrival move.

## Advance a Goal {#toc-crisis-advance}

When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the 
Crisis. There are four different ways of doing this:

- **Smash**  - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Allay**  - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis
- **Rescue** - save people or property endangered by the Crisis

The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to 
advance it once. You donâ€™t need to roll all these successes at once; 
you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too. 

Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, in any
combination, the Crisis ends.

For example, []{.lorem}

## Contribute to the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-contribute}

When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions 
that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything 
you can think of that might give your team an edge. 

You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, 
or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes. 

When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness
to the Teamwork Pool. 

For example, []{.lorem}

## Hero Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves}

[]{.lorem}

### Power Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-power}

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}

#### Joining a Power Combo  {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-join}

**need to clarify: it doesn't cost an action, but you can use each power word only once per phase**

For example, []{.lorem}

### Fighting Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-fighting}

[]{.lorem}

### Skill Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-skill}

[]{.lorem}

### Other Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-other}

[]{.lorem}

#### Timely Arrival {#toc-crisis-timely}

When you use the Timely Arrival move, spend 5 successes from the
Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current 
Hero Phase. 

You can't make any other moves that turn, but you *can* describe 
your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. 
Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.

The cost of the Timely Arrival move decreases by 1 success after 
every Crisis Phase.

#### General Alert {#toc-crisis-alert}

If two or more heroes aren't present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at 
the scene can use their move to sound a General Alert and call for help.
The cost of a General Alert is 1 success from the Teamwork Pool per hero 
called.

The heroes arrive at the start of the *next* Hero Phase, and can act
normally during that Phase. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike
a Timely Arrival, they don't roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.
