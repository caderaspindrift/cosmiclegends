# Countdown to Crisis {#toc-crisis-countdown }

A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem
and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a
location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need 
to present at the start of a Crisis.

The steps to take before a Crisis are:

5. Set the Scene
4. Hero Roll-Call
3. Define the Goals
2. Assemble the Teamwork Pool
1. The Crisis begins!

## Defining the Goals {#toc-crisis-goals}

## Assembling the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-pool}

When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the 
initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of 
describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving
a Crisis. 

If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero
reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using
an Approach related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to
the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for
their heroes.

If your hero is *not* on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it's
being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend
from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.

Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, itâ€™s time to start.

# Starting a Crisis {#toc-crisis-start}

Instead of having an initiative order like many games of this type, 
there are two phases that alternate back and forth: 
the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase. 

The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is 
the Hero Phase.
