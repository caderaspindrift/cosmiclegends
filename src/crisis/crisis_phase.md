# Crisis Phase {#toc-crisis-crisis }

Once every hero has made a move, then it’s time for the Editor
to make moves for the Crisis.

Every Crisis has a set number of moves per Crisis Phase. 
As a rule, the more moves a Crisis gets per Phase, the more 
difficult it is. 
If the Crisis has the same number of moves as the hero team,
it will be very challenging.

The Editor chooses moves from the Crisis’s list of moves. Every
move has a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes 
from the Teamwork Pool, they defend against that move and nothing 
happens.

If there aren’t enough successes in the pool to defend against the
move, or if the heroes decide not to counter the move, then the 
move happens and the heroes face the consequences. 

Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting 
the heroes' ability to use a certain type of roll or move on their 
next turn, or innocents being endangered.

Once the Editor has taken enough Crisis moves, it’s time to go back 
to the heroes.
