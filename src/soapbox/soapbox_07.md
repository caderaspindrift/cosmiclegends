## "Four-Color"

The term "four-color" refers to the printing process used
in comics that led to most heroes having bold, primary
colors for their uniforms, their bodies, their world.

One example is Superman's hair having *blue* overtones --
this was clearly meant to display his hair as lustrous
color of black, but that was beyond the capabilities used
at the time, so they published comics with that weird blue
highlight.

But don't worry -- our use of the term "four-color" doesn't
refer to the printing process we use in this game (although
the PDFs do support 
[2021's CMYK color printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model), 
but instead to the general tone and feel of late Silver-Age
and Bronze-Age comics, when primary-color superheroes of the
1950s and '60s were meeting the social issues of the '70s
and '80s.
