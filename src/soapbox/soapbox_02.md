# Influences

The Super Friends

:   We'll start with the name and the cover art: This game
    is obviously inspired by the 
    [Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends)
    animated television show that was on the air from 1973 
    to 1985 -- incidentally the years that yours truly was
    between five and sixteen.
    
    To say the show had a formative influence might be overselling 
    it, but it *did* influence how I view comics and superheroes
    in general.
    
    The first season has this great opening monologue where
    the late, great Ted Knight intoned that the four heroes --
    obviously, Robin doesn't count for some reason? -- were
    "created from the cosmic legends of the universe!"
    
    What on earth does *that* mean? I *guess* I could see that
    applying to Wonder Woman, but how exactly was Bruce Wayne
    created from the cosmic legends of the universe?!
    
    It was never really clear, but decades later I decided it
    would make a great title for this Bronze-Age, four-color
    tabletop roleplaying game.
