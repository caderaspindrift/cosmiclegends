# Influences & Tone {#toc-influences}

At its heart, []{.gamename} is one of the multitude superhero
games that have come out of the TTRPG hobby -- I've played
Champions, I've played GURPS; I've played DC Heroes, I've
played Marvel Super Heroes; I've played Mutants & Masterminds,
I've played Marvel Heroic Roleplay.

The Harmony Drive system is a nifty system with a lot of very
cool mechanics, and the SRD is a lovely work of art itself.

So obviously, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants here. 
I just hope that []{.gamename} is a worthy contribution to 
the genre and other people can enjoy the game.

On to influences ...

## The Super Friends

We'll start with the name and the cover art: This game
is obviously inspired by the 
[Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends)
animated television show that was on the air from 1973 
to 1985 -- incidentally the years that yours truly was
between five and sixteen.

To say the show had a formative influence might be overselling 
it, but it *did* influence how I view comics and superheroes
in general.

The first season has this great opening monologue where
the late, great Ted Knight intoned that the four heroes --
obviously, Robin doesn't count for some reason? -- were
"created from the cosmic legends of the universe!"

What on earth does *that* mean? I *guess* I could see that
applying to Wonder Woman, but how exactly was Bruce Wayne
created from the cosmic legends of the universe?!

It was never really clear, but decades later I decided it
would make a great title for this Bronze-Age, four-color
tabletop roleplaying game.

## "Bronze Age"

American comics fans and scholars divide the history of U.S.
comics into four loosely defined "ages": the Golden Age, the
Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Modern Age.

The Golden Age (1938 to 1956)

:   The Golden Age started with the introduction of Superman,
    and the creation of the superhero model that's been used for years. 
  
    Many of the most well-known characters, such as Wonder Woman 
    and Captain America, were created during the Golden Age.
  
    Some comics in the Golden Age were just simplistic fun, while
    others feature dark themes, shocking gore, and vile villains.
    There was a lot of punching Nazis back in those days.
    Punching Nazis is always a good thing. 
  
    Unfortunately, racism and sexism often were major themes in Golden 
    Age comics; examples of anti-Asian hatred are all too easy to find.
  
The Silver Age (1956 to circa 1970)

:   The Silver Age began when DC Comics
    created new versions of the Flash, Green Lantern, and others,
    then the Justice League of America. Marvel responded by
    creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Avengers,
    and the Hulk.
  
    With American society talking about "the atomic age" and 
    "the space age," comics followed suit -- creating heroes
    with pseudo-scientific explanations.
  
    The Atom wasn't just a short guy who punched people, but scientist 
    with a size-shifting belt made of "white dwarf matter".
    Green Lantern doesn't have a *magic* ring; I'm not saying it
    came from aliens, but it came from aliens.
    Experiments gone wrong produced so many heroes at Marvel Comics,
    including the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man.
  
    "Radiation" was everywhere -- not the type that gives you cancer,
    but magical sort of radiation that blasted hapless individuals
    and turned them into monsters, heroes, or both.
  
    Another feature of the Silver Age was the Comics Code Authority,
    a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic
    over the content of comics -- including congressional hearings,
    book burnings, and the disputed *Seduction of the Innocent*
    book by Fredric Wertham.
  
    Mainstream comics in the Silver Age therefore followed a long list of 
    prescriptions known as the Comics Code that banned everything
    from "horror" and "gore" to "vampires" and "cannibalism". 
    Heroes in the Silver Age always won, villains always got what
    was comin' to 'em, and authority figures were portrayed 
    positively -- or at least, that's what the CCA demanded.
  
The Bronze Age (ca. 1970 to ca. 1985)

:   The Bronze Age (circa 1970 to circa 1985)** is less distinctly
    defined chronologically, but it's an era where comics went
    through changes: becoming more socially relevant and less
    restrained by the CCA. More on that later.
  
The Modern Age (ca. 1985 to present)

:   The start current age of comics is usually dated to the 
    *Crisis on Infinite Earths* and *Secret Wars* 12-issue series
    published by DC Comics and Marvel Comics, respectively.
    Worlds lived, worlds died, and nothing the creators dreamed of
    was impossible for the publishers to accomplish.

    Darker, mature themes were explored in revitalized titles like
    the *Teen Titans* and *X-Men*, while heroes such as Superman
    and Daredevil had their backstories revamped and retooled
    for a contemporary setting. Antiheroes such as the Punisher
    flourish in the current age of comics.

    The CCA also died off during this period as the major publishers
    increasingly created comics without the CCA seal on the cover, 
    and the Comics Code withered away to nothing.
  
## "Four-Color"

The term "four-color" refers to the printing process used
in comics that led to most heroes having bold, primary
colors for their uniforms, their bodies, their world.

One example is Superman's hair having *blue* overtones --
this was clearly meant to display his hair as lustrous
color of black, but that was beyond the capabilities used
at the time, so they published comics with that weird blue
highlight.

But don't worry -- our use of the term "four-color" doesn't
refer to the printing process we use in this game (although
the PDFs do support 
[2021's CMYK color printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model), 
but instead to the general tone and feel of late Silver-Age
and Bronze-Age comics, when primary-color superheroes of the
1950s and '60s were meeting the social issues of the '70s
and '80s.
