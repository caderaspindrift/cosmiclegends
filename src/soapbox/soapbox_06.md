# The Ages of Comics

The Modern Age - ca. 1985 to present

:   The start current age of comics is usually dated to the 
    *Crisis on Infinite Earths* and *Secret Wars* 12-issue series
    published by DC Comics and Marvel Comics, respectively.
    Worlds lived, worlds died, and nothing the creators dreamed of
    was impossible for the publishers to accomplish.

    Darker, mature themes were explored in revitalized titles like
    the *Teen Titans* and *X-Men*, while heroes such as Superman
    and Daredevil had their backstories revamped and retooled
    for a contemporary setting. Antiheroes such as the Punisher
    flourish in the current age of comics.

    The CCA also died off during this period as the major publishers
    increasingly created comics without the CCA seal on the cover, 
    and the Comics Code withered away to nothing.
