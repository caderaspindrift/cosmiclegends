# The Ages of Comics

The Silver Age - 1956 to circa 1970

:   The Silver Age began when DC Comics
    created new versions of the Flash, Green Lantern, and others,
    then the Justice League of America. Marvel responded by
    creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Avengers,
    and the Hulk.
  
    With American society talking about "the atomic age" and 
    "the space age," comics followed suit -- creating heroes
    with pseudo-scientific explanations.
  
    The Atom wasn't just a short guy who punched people, but scientist 
    with a size-shifting belt made of "white dwarf matter".
    Green Lantern doesn't have a *magic* ring; I'm not saying it
    came from aliens, but it came from aliens.
    Experiments gone wrong produced so many heroes at Marvel Comics,
    including the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man.
  
    "Radiation" was everywhere -- not the type that gives you cancer,
    but magical sort of radiation that blasted hapless individuals
    and turned them into monsters, heroes, or both.
  
    Another feature of the Silver Age was the Comics Code Authority,
    a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic
    over the content of comics -- including congressional hearings,
    book burnings, and the disputed *Seduction of the Innocent*
    book by Fredric Wertham.
  
    Mainstream comics in the Silver Age therefore followed a long list of 
    prescriptions known as the Comics Code that banned everything
    from "horror" and "gore" to "vampires" and "cannibalism". 
    Heroes in the Silver Age always won, villains always got what
    was comin' to 'em, and authority figures were portrayed 
    positively -- or at least, that's what the CCA demanded.
