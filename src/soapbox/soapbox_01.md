# Influences {#toc-influences}

At its heart, []{.gamename} is one of the multitude superhero
games that have come out of the TTRPG hobby -- I've played
Champions, I've played GURPS; I've played DC Heroes, I've
played Marvel Super Heroes; I've played Mutants & Masterminds,
I've played Marvel Heroic Roleplay.

The Harmony Drive system is a nifty system with a lot of very
cool mechanics, and the SRD is a lovely work of art itself.

So obviously, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants here. 
I just hope that []{.gamename} is a worthy contribution to 
the genre and other people can enjoy the game.
