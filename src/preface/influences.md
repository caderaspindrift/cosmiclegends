## The Super Friends {#toc-preface-super-friends}

In case you weren't aware, this game is inspired by the 
[Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends){.external}
cartoon show that was on the air from 1973 to 1985 -- also
the years yours truly was age 5 and 16. It's fair to say
the show influenced how I view comics and superheroes
in general.

The first season has an opening monologue where the four 
heroes were "created from the cosmic legends of the universe!"

What on earth does *that* mean?  How exactly was *millionaire playboy 
Bruce Wayne* created from the __cosmic legends of the universe__?!
I've never figured that out, but it does make a great title
for our litle Bronze-Age-inspired, four-color superhero tabletop RPG.
