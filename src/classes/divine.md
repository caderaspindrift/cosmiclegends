- As a Power Display, costing no Might
- As a Power Stunt, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first

- Joining a Power Combo, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase.

You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo,
or 2 Might to add both.
