    You are imbued with power that originates with one or more deities, 
    or at least powerful extra-planar beings who may have been once
    worshipped as gods.
- playing:
    As a Divine hero, you have a wide range of abilities to choose from.
    Look for ways you can find synergy with other heroes -- if they
    join in a Power Combo that you initiate, your \*Give Me Strength!\*
    ability applies to the dice they provide, too.
- questions:
  - "Are you a deity yourself?":
    - "A demigod?"
    - "The champion of one or more deities?"
    - "Or even someone who figuratively or literally stole power from the gods?"
  - "What god, gods or pantheon are you associated with?":
    - "Do you gain power from your association with a single deity, or do multiple gods grant you power?"
    - "Are your powers bestowed by the gods, or are they a result of your own divine essence?"
  - "How do you relate to the god(s) who empower you?":
    - "Are you on good terms with them, are they distant and silent, or have they sent you to a mortal existence for your own good?"
    - "Are there other gods or other people empowered by the gods, and if so, how do you get along with them?"
  - "Are there any mythological monsters or enemies that your choice of a divine power source implies?":
  - "Do you have a single form and identity, or do you change through supernatural means between your Divine form and a \"mortal\" one?":
    - "If so, what triggers such a change -- a spoken word, a transformation sequence, or just calling upon your Divine powers?"
  - "If you're not a mortal yourself, what *do* you think of the mortal world?":
    - "Does it mystify you, or are you thoroughly immersed in modern culture?"
    - "What are your views on religion -- both your hero's own religion and those that could be seen as rival faiths?"
- skills:

      "It's a staple of superhero comic books that real-life
      deities are portrayed as either heroes themselves or the
      sources of power for a hero.
      
      There's an assumption that these \"aren't *real* gods who
      are sacred to anyone any more\" -- but that's not necessarily true 
      at all. For example, some modern pagans revere one or
      more of the gods of Norse mythology.
      
      You should be careful when you use mythological deities,
      *especially* those from a culture that's foreign to you.
      Check with the other players and the Editor, and be prepared
      to change either your Divine hero or the concept behind
      them."
