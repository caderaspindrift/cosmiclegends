# Ability Categories

There are four categories of abilities that all use similar mechanics:

- **Arsenal Abilities** let you pick a number of single-use Core
  Power Words at the start of a Storyline;
- **Crossover Abilities** give you access to Power Words (and, usually,
  abilities) from another class;
- **Hero Cave Abilities** give you a personal headquarters where
  you can store your trophies or use your skills;
- **Pet Abilities** let you have an animal companion, familiar,
  or special pet that accompanies you.

For **Arsenal**, **Hero Cave**, and **Pet** Abilities, the following
rules apply:

- You can have only one ability of each type. 
- Thus you can have only one Arsenal ability, one Hero Cave ability, 
  and one Pet ability.

For **Crossover** Abilities, the following rules apply:

- Each Crossover Ability is tied to a specific class;
- You can't already be a member of that class (including via 
  Multi-Class or Dual-Class options);
- You can't take a second Crossover Ability tied to that class.
- Some Crossover Abilities let you take abilities from that
  class instead of your own class; however, ...
- You can't take a Crossover Ability as a result of another
  Crossover Ability. For example, if you take a Crossover (Mage)
  Ability that lets you take a Mage class ability instead of one
  of your class abilities, you can't take a Mage class ability
  that's a Crossover ability.
