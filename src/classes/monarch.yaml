    "You are a leader in a city, nation, or people who exist outside of
    mainstream international society. 
  
    Your ways may seem unorthodox and even arrogant to those unfamiliar
    with your culture, but their ignorance can be excused ... mostly.
  
    Although you fight for justice and freedom for all, you feel a special
    obligation to protect your home -- even if you don't currently live
    there."

    "Your Monarch hero is most strongly defined by their home than by their
    Powers, Approaches, or Skills. You're most effective against threats
    against that home. 

    It's up to you to decide if any given Crisis endangers your domain, 
    so you may want to ask the Editor or other players during the 
    Countdown to Crisis about ideas to tie your home to the current 
    situation."
- questions: 
  - "Where is your home located?":
    - "How does its location serve to isolate it from other cultures?"
    - "Is your home open to outsiders, or sealed off?"
  - "What kind of distinct cultural traditions from your home could be seen as strange to outsiders?":
    - "And conversely, what \"outsider\" customs are either baffling or unacceptable to you?"
  - "Which languages are spoken in your home?":
    - "Do the people of your home know any languages of outsiders?"
    - "Is there a particular accent common to your people?"
  - "Are your powers common to everyone from your home, or are you unique?":
    - "Do your powers descend from your lineage?"
    - "Do you have additional abilities based on your rank as a leader?"
  - "What's your current status in your home?":
    - "Do you live there?"
    - "Are you the reigning monarch, or an heir in line for the throne?"
    - "If you're not the monarch regnant, who is, and how do you feel about each other?"
    - "Have you been exiled from your home, and if so -- for what reason?"

      "You can define any details you like about your Monarch's
      home. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't be aware of
      real-world stereotypes, bigotries, and privilege.

      Your Monarch's home is *never* somewhere that exists --
      or could exists -- in the real world. You can live on the
      Moon, or in the Antarctic, or under the Pacific Ocean, or
      in an adjacent dimension, or on a floating city -- but you
      can't be the Monarch of China or Uganda or Pittsburgh.

      Check in regularly with your fellow players and the Editor
      to make sure that you're not straying into problematic
      stereotypes, including accents, as you play your Monarch."

              they're not quite at the level of a Knight or an Expert, they all have
              at least one special talent that assists you in fighting crime, and are
              sworn to keep your secrets (if you have any).
          
              Included with this Ability is a reliable and discreet way to contact your
              subjects. As a Move during the Hero Phase of a Crisis, you can spend 1 Might
              to contact one or all of your Loyal Subjects.
          
              When you first gain this Ability, create a list of subjects, with a number of
              entries on the list equal to the Volume. Add an additional subject before each
              subsequent Volume.
          
              Each subject is defined by three qualities: First, their name. Secondly, their
              favored Approach. And thirdly, a Skill that defines their expertise and/or
              \"day job.\"
          
              For example, you could create a photojournalist named James Bartholomew and
              assign him \"Action\" as a favored Approach, and Journalist as his skill.
          
              Any subject you call in has a score of 1 for all Approaches save their favored
              Approach (which is a 4), a maximum Might score equal to the Volume, and a
              maximum Health score equal to the Volume.
          
              Without spending any Might to contact one or more Loyal Subjects, you
