# The Expatriate {#toc-expatriate .breakbefore .class}

> 

Just a machine.

That's all they say you are. Created in a lab, created by other
people, originally from non-living material.

Who *doesn't* that describe?

Do your origins make you any *less* of a person?

You're more than just a simple gadget or toy. You've found there
is more to being a person than simply being born human or looking
like they do.


## Playing a Construct

Your hero is really, really good at breaking things. You're going
to want to advance the Smash goal whenever you can, but keep in
mind that you're more than *just* muscle. You have Skills, Abilities,
and possibly other Power Words that you can use switch up your
moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.

## Questions

As you create your Monstrosity hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::
- How do you look different from normal humans? 
  - How much larger are you than other people? 
  - What color is your skin, and what does it feel like? 
  - What kind of strange appearance do you have that
    makes the ignorant assume you're a mere brute? 
  - What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do you employ?
- Are you *always* a monster? 
  - If not, what triggers that change? 
  - Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, or your own
    choice? 
  - Will people not like you when you're angry?
  - *Were* you always a monster?
- What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people? 
  - Are you an artist at heart, a scientist, a poet, a doctor, a pilot? 
- Why *aren't* you the monster they say you are? 
  - What makes you a *hero* and not a villain or mindless threat? 
  - What would push you over that edge, and how have you avoided going 
    over it so far?
