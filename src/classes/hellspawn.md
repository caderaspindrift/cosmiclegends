## Real-World Religions? {#soapbox-real-world-religions-hellspawn}

It's a staple of superhero comic books that real-life
deities are portrayed as either heroes themselves or the
sources of power for a hero.

There's an assumption that these "aren't *real* gods who
are sacred to anyone any more" -- but that's not necessarily
true at all. For example, many modern pagans revere one or
more of the Norse gods of myth.

You should be careful when you use mythological deities,
*especially* those from a culture that's foreign to you.
Check in with the other players and the Editor, and be prepared
to change either your Hellspawn hero or the concept behind
them.
