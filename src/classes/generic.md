    This is a *Hero Cave* Ability.

Break the Fourth Wall
:   Your hero knows they're in a comic book -- or, at least, in a 
    tabletop roleplaying game.
    When you roll to advance the Outwit goal, if you reference this
    knowledge in a nonsensical way, count all 4s, 5s, or 6s as 
    successes.

Arsenal
:   *Prerequisite: You can't have another __Arsenal__ Ability.*
    At the start of each Storyline, pick a number of Power Words
    from the Inventor or Knight Personal Power Words Lists
    equal to the Volume.
    You can use each such Power Word as a Core Power Word once
    during the current Storyline without paying any Might.
    This is an *Arsenal* Ability.

Hero Without Fear
:   You are completely fearless. If you are exposed to any fear-
    based effects, spend 1 Might to counter that use for you only.
    Your lack of fear lets you take risks to save others without
    concern for your own safety: You can choose to add 2 dice when 
    you roll to advance the Rescue goal. If you do, lose 1 Health 
    or 1 Might after resolving the roll.Choose any two or three single words you like; these are your
**Nova Power Words**.

At the start of any Storyline, your Nova Power Words are **Locked** and
you can't use them in Power Displays, Stunts, or Combos.

When you mark all your Ideals, your Nova Power Words are **Unlocked**
until the end of the current Storyline.

You can use one of your *Unlocked* Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt

or Combo for free; if you spend 1 Might, you can include a second
Nova Power Word as well.

You can use one or more of your *Locked* Nova Power Words in a Power

Display, Stunt, or Combo by spending 1 Might per Nova Power Word.
The Nova Power Word remains *Locked*.

Local Hero
:   You and your home town are near synonymous. 
    You know the geography of the city like the back of your hand. 
    Add the name of your city as a Core Power Word.
    Add 2 dice whenever you make a skill roll related to the city. 
    While you're in your home city, add 2 dice when you roll to advance 
    the Allay or Rescue goals.

    *Repetition* You can take this Ability more than once. When you do, 
    choose another city in which you can use this Ability.
