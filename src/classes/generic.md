    This is a *Hero Cave* Ability.

Break the Fourth Wall
:   Your hero knows they're in a comic book -- or, at least, in a 
    tabletop roleplaying game.
    When you roll to advance the Outwit goal, if you reference this
    knowledge in a nonsensical way, count all 4s, 5s, or 6s as 
    successes.

Hero Without Fear
:   You are completely fearless. If you are exposed to any fear-
    based effects, spend 1 Might to counter that use for you only.
    Your lack of fear lets you take risks to save others without
    concern for your own safety: You can choose to add 2 dice when 
    you roll to advance the Rescue goal. If you do, lose 1 Health 
    or 1 Might after resolving the roll.

Local Hero
:   You and your home town are nearly synonymous. 
    You know the geography of the city like the back of your hand. 
    Add the name of your city as a single Core Power Word.
    Add 2 dice whenever you make a skill roll related to the city. 
    While you're in your home city, add 2 dice when you roll to advance 
    the Allay or Rescue goals.

    *Repetition* You can take this Ability more than once. When you do, 
    choose another city covered by this Ability.

Chameleon
:   You can change your physical features to match any person you've
    ever met, or a combination of such features.
    Add "Disguise" as a Core Power Word.
    When you use "Disguise" in a Power Display, Power Stunt, or
    Power Combo roll to advance the Outwit goal, add 2 to the 
    Effectiveness of that roll.

Eidetic Memory
:   You have what's sometimes called *photographic memory* -- you have perfect
    recall of anything you see, hear, read, or otherwise experience.
    Add 3 dice when you make a skill roll related to memory or knowledge.

Weirdness Magnet

:   Strange things happen around you *all the time*. This means you
    are more likely to be on the scene whenever a Crisis breaks out!
    If your hero isn't present at the start of a Crisis, you can
    spend 1 Might during the *Teamwork Pool - Assemble!* phase of the
    *Countdown to Crisis* to say that you've been there the whole time.
    If you do, add 3 dice when you roll to create the initial Teamwork 
    Pool.
