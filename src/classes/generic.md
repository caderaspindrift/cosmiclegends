## Playing the Twins

You have Skills, Abilities, and possibly other Power Words that 
you can use to switch up your moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.

## Questions

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Skills

You have the **Explorer** skill, plus two additional skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses one of your skills, add 1 extra die. If
you have more than one skill that could apply to a roll, add 1 extra die for each
applicable skill.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until it is off cooldown.
