    Stand back, everyone. This one's gonna hurt.

    You're a living source of energy. Whether you generate it
    yourself or tap into another plane of existence, you can use
    that energy as a blast, an explosion, a punch, and more.
- playing: |
    This makes you especially good at blowing things up; in fights, you
    use up Might quickly, but regain it almost as quickly. Dynamo is one
    of the few classes that gets a third Core Power Word, so use that
    to increase your dice pools by spending Might freely.
- questions:
  - "What type of energy do you use? ":
    - "Do you produce it yourself, or does it come from another source?"
    - "How exactly did you gain your power to use this energy?"
  - "What visual, audible, and olfactory signatures accompany your power?":
    - "Is there a color associated with this energy, like silver, purple, or gold?"
    - "Do you crackle with energy?"
    - "An earth-shattering kaboom when your power goes off, a simple \"ZOT\" or something else?"
    - "A burnt smell, or ozone, or petrichor?"
  - "How does your hero feel about these powers?":
    - "Do you revel in them, happy to show off? "
    - "Or are you more restrained, afraid to let loose with your full strength?"
    - "Have your powers ever harmed anyone else?":
