## Playing a Kid

You have Skills, Abilities, and possibly other Power Words that 
you can use to switch up your moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.

## Questions

As you create your Kid hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::
- How do you look different from normal humans? 
  - How much larger (or smaller) are you than other people? 
  - What color is your skin, and what does it feel and look like? 
  - What kind of strange appearance do you have that makes the ignorant 
    assume you're just an animalistic brute?
  - What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do 
    you employ?
- Are you *always* a kid?  
  (If not, then you may want to consider playing your hero as 
   <a href="#toc-multi-class">Multi-Class Hero</a> -- this is appropriate
   for heroes who magically transform from child form to an adult shape!)
  - If not, what triggers that change? 
    Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, a magic word,
    or your own free will? 
  - How do you get along with adult heroes? Do you look up to them as
    role models? Do they usually talk down to you?
  - In what ways are you less mature than the average hero?
  - In what ways are you more mature than the average hero?
  - Were you *always* a hero? How did you become one? Why did you
    become one?
  - Do you have any other friends your age, or do you just associate with
    adult heroes?
- What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people? 
  - Are you an artist at heart, a scientist, a poet, a doctor, a pilot? 
  - What would push you over that edge, and how have you avoided going 
    over it so far?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Skills

You have the **Academic** skill, plus two additional skills of your choice
chosen from the following list:

- Artist

Whenever you make a roll that uses one of your skills, add 1 extra die. If
you have more than one skill that could apply to a roll, add 1 extra die for each
applicable skill.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until it is off cooldown.

You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt

## Totem Abilities {.class}

Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class.
Your Kid abilities show your increasing ability to compete with
adult heroes and handle serious threats.  Each ability can be 
chosen only once.

### Prime Ability

Your hero has the **Why, It's Just a Child** Prime ability common 
to all Kid heroes.

:::::: {.ability-list .prime }::::::::::
Why, It's Just a Child

:   Most adults underestimate you. Add the Volume to the dice pool 
    when you roll to advance the Outwit goal against a source that's
    older than you.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Volume 1 Abilities

At the start of Volume 1, choose two abilities from this list.

::::: {.ability-list .v1 } ::::::::::

Animal Partner

:   You have an unusually intelligent pet or companion that accompanies
    you on your heroic adventures. This partner has three Core Power Words --
    one matching your Totem Nature Power Word, and two others from the
    Totem Personal Power Words List -- that you can use for free without
    spending Might, each once per Hero Phase. Your animal partner's 
    Health and Might equal the Volume.

    Choose one Skill possessed by your Animal Partner, and a Fighting
    Style. You can use that skill or Fighting Style whenever your 
    Animal Partner is present during a Crisis.

    During any Hero Phase, either your hero can make a move or your
    animal partner can make a move -- not both.

    *Prerequisite: The __Mystic Totem__ class ability.* 
    If your animal partner is ever killed, they return to life at the 
    end of the next Crisis Countdown, and join you as soon as they
    can.

Comic Relief

:   Whenever you make a roll, count 2s as Edge Successes in 
    addition to 1s. If the consequence is funny and at least one
    adult hero present laughs at the situation or your reaction to it, 
    count each Edge Success for which you accept the consequence as two
    successes when you calculate the roll's Effectiveness.

Unbeatable

:   Your powers cause people to under-estimate you and you actually punch can
    punch far above your normal weight class.
    Whenever you have one or more companions of the same type as your
    Totem Nature Power Word present -- including from the *Animal Companion* or
    *Summon Swarm* class abilities -- add 1 to the Effectiveness of any roll
    you make to advance any goal.

    When you take this class ability, choose one hero and, with that
    player's agreement, they become your mentor.

    Kid Personal Power Words List or from any Core, Nova, or Personal
    Power Words possessed by your Mentor.

    once per Hero Phase, as if you had the Skill yourself.

    you roll to advance the Outwit goal against a source that's
    older than you.

Pet

:   You have an unusually intelligent pet or companion that accompanies
    you on your heroic adventures. 

    [Totem]{.crossover}
    This partner has three Core Power Words --
    one chosen from the Totem Class's Totem Nature Power Words List,
    and two others from the Totem Class's Personal Power Words List -- 
    that you can use for free without spending Might, each once per Hero 
    Phase. Your animal partner's Health and Might equal the Volume.

    Choose one Skill possessed by your Animal Partner, and a Fighting
    Style. You can use that skill or Fighting Style whenever your 
    Animal Partner is present during a Crisis.

    During any Hero Phase, either your hero can make a move or your
    animal partner can make a move -- not both.

Magical Familiar

    choose from the Divine Class Personal Power Words List or the
    Mage Class Personal Power Words List. 


    [Divine, Mage]{.crossover .es}
    These become Core Power
    Words that you can use for free, each once per Hero Phase, as
    described in the *Pet* class ability.

    If your Magical Familiar is ever killed, they return to life at 
    the end of the next Crisis Countdown, and join you as soon as they
    can.

Alien Pet

:   *Prerequisite: You must have the __Pet__ class ability.*
    Your pet isn't from Earth -- or might not even be from this universe,
    in the case of a magical pet.

    [Monstrosity, Totem]{.crossover .es}
    Whenever you choose a Core Power Word for your Pet, you can choose 
    from the Monstrosity Class Personal Power Words List or the
    Paragon Class Personal Power Words List. These become Core Power
    Words that you can use for free, once per Hero Phase, as described 
    in the *Pet* class ability.
    
Holy Catchphrase!

:   Once per Hero Phase, you can make a pun related to one of the
    Scene Power Words or an Ideal that you or another hero Marked
    since the start of the last Hero Phase. If you do, add 3 to the
    next roll you or any other hero makes before the end of the current
    Hero Phase.
    
Intelligent Pet

:   *Prerequisite: You must have the __Pet__ class ability.*
    Your pet is smarter than an average animal of that type. It can
    communicate intelligently in one language that you choose when
    you gain this class ability, although its voice is clearly
    non-human. 

    In addition, choose a second Skill possessed by
    the Pet, and one Approach. Whenever your Pet is present at a
    Crisis, add 3 dice whenever you make a roll using the chosen
    Approach.

Youthful Power

:   You are a storehouse of indefatiguable energy. Increase your maximum 
    Might by 5.
