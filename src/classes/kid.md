you can use to switch up your moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.

you have more than one skill that could apply to a roll, add 1 extra die for each

- As a **Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until it is off cooldown.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Youthful** and **Exuberance**.
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt 
or Combo, 2 Might to add two, and 3 Might to add all three.

these are your **Nova Power Words**, and together are known as your
