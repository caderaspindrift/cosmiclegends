# The Wheelman {#toc-wheelman .breakbefore .class}

> I know secrets about you that you don't even know yourself.

Psychics are masters of mind powers, able to communicate
with others and link minds together.

Their powers are often purely mental without a physical
manifestation; a duel between two Psychics could take place
in the middle of a crowded restaurant with no one any the
wiser.

If normal people knew that a Psychic was among them -- and could 
potentially access their innermost thoughts and desires! --
they would react with fear and hostility. Some Psychics will
pose as some other type of hero to avoid such prejudices ... even
as they admit such biases might not be entirely unwarranted.

## Playing a Wheelman

Your Psychic hero is likely the lynchpin of the team, although
not necessarily the leader. This is a passive ability, though --
unless you choose otherwise, everyone's connected when you're
present -- so look for ways to use your own Power Words, Skills,
and Abilities in creative and original ways.

## No Ethical Mind Control Under Capitalism

Many comic books and roleplaying games will gloss over
it, but I'll state it directly: nearly any use of mind
control powers represents gross violations of another
person's autonomy and consent.

This doesn't mean you can't *ever* do that in an Issue
of []{.gamename}, but it means that you have to be careful
and safe by checking in with the other players and the
Editor -- because your Psychic hero is probably doing
something that's quite horrific if you're using mind
control.

During Issue 0 or the start of an Issue, you should ask
the other players and the Editor about whether they view
reading someone's mind without consent as the same kind
of violation. Are surface thoughts fine, but deep memories
not? You *need* to have these kinds of talks, as a group,
before it comes up in play.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Questions

As you create your Psychic hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::
- How do you come by these amazing mental powers? 
  - What kind of training or education did you undertake to master them?
- Are there obvious signs to your powers, such as an enlarged forehead,
  glowing eyes, or a visible crackle of power -- or are they completely
  invisible and undetectable?
- What limits have you imposed on your own power due to ethical and
  moral concerns? 
  - What type of actions won't you take, and what would
    push you to actually commit those acts? 
  - What makes you a *hero* and not
    a mind-powered villain, looting others' skulls with impunity?
- What kind of mental self-image do you have?
  - Does your telepathic voice "sound" like your *physical* voice? 
  - Do others recognize you when you make mental contact with you? 
- Do you have any *physical* limitations, such as a disability? 
  - How do your powers compensate for those limits, and in what ways can
    they never fully substitute for them?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Skills

You have the **Engineer** and **Pilot** skills, plus two
additional skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number 
of dice equal to the Volume.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Power Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Focused** and **Totality**.
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo,
or 2 Might to add both.

Your Psychic Abilities are new ways to channel your psionic
power.
Each ability can be chosen only once.

### Prime Ability

Your hero has the **Our Minds As One** Prime ability common
to all Psychics.

:::::: {.ability-list .prime }::::::::::
Our Minds As One
:   As long as you are conscious, and there is at least one
    Success in the Teamwork Pool, you and the other heroes
    can communicate telepathically.

    If all of the partipants in a Power Combo are part of your
    Mind Link, the initiating hero adds 2 to the roll.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Volume 1 Abilities

:::::: {.ability-list .v1 } :::::::::

    a crowd. Add 2 to the dice pool when you use a Power to

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Volume 2 Abilities

At the start of Volume 2, choose an ability from this list or the Volume 1 list.

:::::::: {.ability-list .v2 } :::::::
Mind Over Matter

:   You can keep yourself conscious through sheer force of will.
    Instead of losing Health, you can lose an equal amount
    of Might.

Psychic Healing

:   You gain **Healing** as a Core Power Word.
    As a move, you can use your mental powers to heal someone else.
    They regain Health equal to the Effectiveness of a Power roll
    using the *Healing* Power Word.

Psychic Gestalt

:   *Prerequisite: The __Our Minds As One__ psychic class core ability.*
    *Prerequisite: the __Skill Sharing__ class ability.*
    As a move, you and any willing heroes who are affected by your
    Our Minds As One ability can create a fusion being, centered on
    you and controlled by you. This gestalt has the following
    characteristics:
    - A physical body is created for the gestalt, that can look like
      whatever you decide it looks like. Giant brains or idealized
      human forms are the most common, often with the latter being a
      composite of various physical features of the members of the
      gestalt. This artificial body can be killed -- if it is, the 
      gestalt breaks apart (as described below) and you (personally) 
      die.
    - The members of the gestalt become beings of pure psionic
      energy connected to the gestalt's form, who can advise and 
      communicate with each other but no longer have physical bodies;
      they maintain their separate consciousnesses and identities,
      and cannot be affected apart from the gestalt by any power,
      ability, or rule.
    - Opponents with at least one Power Word that appears on the
      Psychic Personal Power Words List can, as a move during the
      Crisis Phase, try to break apart the gestalt. The cost to counter 
      this move equals the Volume.
    - The gestalt has a unique name, which you and the other heroes 
      can choose, and has access to the memories, knowledge, and 
      feelings of all heroes that are part of it. Every time you
      use this ability with the same group heroes, that named gestalt
      is formed; it remembers its previous periods of existence and
      emotional state(s).
    - Whenever an ability or rule refers to "you" while the gestalt is
      active, it's talking about the gestalt as a whole -- and *you*,
      as the initiator with the Psychic Gestalt class ability -- are
      in control of the combined entity.
    - The gestalt has access to every Skill possessed by any member
      of the gestalt.
    - The gestalt has access to every Fighting Style possessed by any
      member of the gestalt.
    - Whenever any hero **leaves the gestalt** -- including if the gestalt
      is **willingly or unwillingly broken apart** -- then:
      - That hero's current Health and Might are equal to the gestalt's
        score divided by the number of heroes who originally formed the
        gestalt, rounded down.
      - The hero doesn't remember what happened during the time they
        were part of the gestalt, except as dream-like memories
    - Scores for each Approach equal to the highest value for that
      approach among the members of the gestalt
    - Maximum Health equal to the sum of the Maximum Health of every
      member of the gestalt
    - Maximum Might equal to the sum of the Maximum Might of every
      member of the gestalt
    - Current Health equal to its Maximum Health, as calculated above
    - Current Might equal to its Maximum Might, as calculated above
    - **Gestalt**, **Shared**, **Flight**, **Psionic** and **Unleashed**
      as Core Power Words
    - Each player of a hero who is part of the gestalt chooses one
      Power Word from the Paragon Persoanl Power Words List; you (as
      the gestalt) gain those words as **Core Power Words**
    - All the Core and Personal Power Words possessed by any member of
      the gestalt
    - At the start of the Hero Phase, the gestalt refreshes Might equal
      to the number of heroes that currently comprise it
    - During the Hero Phase, you (personally) choose what the gestalt 
      does as a move or other action
    - If the Teamwork Pool is ever reduced to zero, **the gestalt 
      collapses** and each hero's current Might and Health are set 
      equal to the gestalt's current values divided by the number of
      heroes who originally formed the gestalt, rounded down -- as
      described above.
    - If there are no longer any heroes who comprise the gestalt, it
      collapses with the effects described immediately above.
    - Once per Hero Phase, each member of the gestalt can only make one 
      move from the following: **Withdraw from the Gestalt** or 
      **Add to the Teamwork Pool**
      - **Withdraw from the Gestalt** By spending 1 from the Teamwork
        Pool, any hero can choose to withdraw from the gestalt. Their
        Health and Might are calculated as described above, but the
        Health and Might of the gestalt are not affected. Recalculate
        the maximum Health and Might, and reduce the gestalt's current
        values for each if they exceed the new maximum value.
      - **Add to the Teamwork Pool**
        As a move, a hero in the gestalt can reinforce the Teamwork
        Pool through telepathic communication with the other members
        of the gestalt. This can be used as a memory-based Vignette 
        between two members of the gestalt, to *mark* *Ideals*.
    - The gestalt has access to all of your Psychic Class abilities
      and any Psychic Class abilities possessed by other members of the
      gestalt. You can choose when and how to use each of those.
    - If you, as the initiator of the gestalt, choose to Withdraw from
      the Gestalt, you can use a move during the Hero Phase and spend one
      from the Teamwork Pool; the gestalt immediately breaks apart as 
      described above.
    - You can also, as a move during the Hero Phase, can spend 1 from the
      Teamwork Pool to eject any hero from the gestalt. If this reduces
      the number of heroes in the gestalt to 0, or the value of the
      Teamwork Pool to 0, the gestalt collapses as described above.

Separate Gestalt

:     *Prerequisite: the __Psychic Gestalt__ class ability.*
      When you form a Psychic Gestalt, the gestalt is a separate 
      hero character also controlled by you. The other heroes'
      physical forms do not vanish and they can act independently,
      as they normally could.
