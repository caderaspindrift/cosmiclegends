# The Wheelman {#toc-wheelman .breakbefore .class}

> I know secrets about you that you don't even know yourself.

Psychics are masters of mind powers, able to communicate
with others and link minds together.

Their powers are often purely mental without a physical
manifestation; a duel between two Psychics could take place
in the middle of a crowded restaurant with no one any the
wiser.

If normal people knew that a Psychic was among them -- and could 
potentially access their innermost thoughts and desires! --
they would react with fear and hostility. Some Psychics will
pose as some other type of hero to avoid such prejudices ... even
as they admit such biases might not be entirely unwarranted.

## Playing a Wheelman

Your Psychic hero is likely the lynchpin of the team, although
not necessarily the leader. This is a passive ability, though --
unless you choose otherwise, everyone's connected when you're
present -- so look for ways to use your own Power Words, Skills,
and Abilities in creative and original ways.

## No Ethical Mind Control Under Capitalism

Many comic books and roleplaying games will gloss over
it, but I'll state it directly: nearly any use of mind
control powers represents gross violations of another
person's autonomy and consent.

This doesn't mean you can't *ever* do that in an Issue
of []{.gamename}, but it means that you have to be careful
and safe by checking in with the other players and the
Editor -- because your Psychic hero is probably doing
something that's quite horrific if you're using mind
control.

During Issue 0 or the start of an Issue, you should ask
the other players and the Editor about whether they view
reading someone's mind without consent as the same kind
of violation. Are surface thoughts fine, but deep memories
not? You *need* to have these kinds of talks, as a group,
before it comes up in play.

## Questions

As you create your Psychic hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::
- How do you come by these amazing mental powers? 
  - What kind of training or education did you undertake to master them?
- Are there obvious signs to your powers, such as an enlarged forehead,
  glowing eyes, or a visible crackle of power -- or are they completely
  invisible and undetectable?
- What limits have you imposed on your own power due to ethical and
  moral concerns? 
  - What type of actions won't you take, and what would
    push you to actually commit those acts? 
  - What makes you a *hero* and not
    a mind-powered villain, looting others' skulls with impunity?
- What kind of mental self-image do you have?
  - Does your telepathic voice "sound" like your *physical* voice? 
  - Do others recognize you when you make mental contact with you? 
- Do you have any *physical* limitations, such as a disability? 
  - How do your powers compensate for those limits, and in what ways can
    they never fully substitute for them?

## Wheelman Abilities {.class}

Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class.
Your Wheelman class abilities represent upgrades or changes to
your *Unique Vehicle*. Each ability can be chosen only once.

### Prime Ability

Your hero has the **Unique Vehicle** Prime ability common
to all Wheelmen. Additional class abilities you can choose in
later Volumes can increase the capabilities of your *Unique
Vehicle*.

:::::: {.ability-list .prime }::::::::::
Unique Vehicle
:   You have a custom-built vehicle unlike any other. When you
    are in your vehicle, no one can compare to your driving and/or
    piloting skill.

    Your Unique Vehicle's **Maximum Health** and **Maximum Might**
    equal the **sum of your own Maximum Health plus your Maximum 
    Might**. When your maximum Health or Might change, recalculate 
    the Vehicle's Maximum Health and Maximum Might.

    The type of vehicle matches the Vehicle Core Power Word that
    you chose. Each Unique Vehicle has a set of Vehicle Scene Power 
    Words associated with it.

    Your Unique Vehicle can comfortably carry a number of human-sized
    passengers equal to the Volume.

    Whenever you add a Personal Power Word, you can instead add a
    Vehicle Scene Power Word from the Vehicle Scene Power Words List.

    In addition, you are considered to have the **Ace Fighting Style**
    whenever you are in your Unique Vehicle.

### Volume 1 Abilities

At the start of Volume 1, choose two abilities from this list.

:::::: {.ability-list .v1 } :::::::::

Intelligent Vehicle

:   *Prerequisite: __Unique Vehicle__ class ability.*
    Your Unique Vehicle is sentient and can communicate with you.
    Choose one of the five Approaches. The Vehicle's score for that
    Approach equals the Volume plus 2.

    While you are in your Vehicle, you can use the Vehicle's score
    for that Approach instead of your own.

    In addition, choose one Skill possessed by the Vehicle. When you
    are in the Vehicle, you are considered to have that skill.

    You *can* have a Vignette with your own Unique Vehicle.

Dude, Where's Your Car?

:   *Prerequisite: __Autonomous Operation__ class ability.*
    During the Roll-Call phase of a Crisis Countdown, you can decide 
    if your Vehicle is present at the scene. If it isn't, then you 
    can use the Timely Arrival move and pay only 1 success from the
    Teamwork Pool, not 5 (the normal cost).

    When your Vehicle arrives, you automatically enter it and are
    in control.
    
Haunted Vehicle

:   *Prerequisite: __Intelligent Vehicle__ class ability.*
    Your Vehicle isn't merely intelligent, but is possessed by the
    ghost of a human or other creature. 

    Choose one Personal Power Word from the Haunt class and add it as
    a Vehicle Scene Power Word. Whenever you add a new Vehicle Scene
    Power Word, you can choose from the Haunt Personal Power Words List
    or the Vehicle Scene Power Words List; such Power Words become 
    Vehicle Scene Power Words.

    In addition, you gain the **Mystic Skill**.

Cursed Vehicle

:   *Prerequisite: __Intelligent Vehicle__ class ability.*
    Like the *Haunted Vehicle* class ability, your Vehicle is possessed
    by a supernatural creature.

    Choose one Personal Power Word from the Hellspawn class and add it as
    a Vehicle Scene Power Word. Whenever you add a new Vehicle Scene
    Power Word, you can choose from the Hellspan Personal Power Words
    List or the Vehicle Scene Power Words List; such Power Words become
    Vehicle Scene Power Words.

    In addition, you gain the **Mystic Skill**.

High-Tech Vehicle

:   *Prerequisite: __Intelligent Vehicle__ class ability.*
    Your Vehicle is controlled by a computerized, artificial intelligence.

    Choose one Personal Power Word from the Inventor Class Personal
    Power Words List or the Construct Class Personal Power Words List,
    and add it as a Vehicle Scene Power Word. Whenever
    you add a new Vehicle Scene Power Word, you can choose from the
    Inventor Class Personal Power Words List, the Vehicle Scene Power Words
    List, or the Construct Class Personal Power Words List; such Power 
    Words become Vehicle Scene Power Words associated with your Unique
    Vehicle.

    In addition, you gain the **Engineer Skill**.

Autonomous Operation

:   *Prerequisite: __Intelligent Vehicle__ class ability.*
    Your Vehicle can act whenever you are unable to. At the end of each
    Hero Phase, if you didn't make a move, then you can have your Vehicle
    make a move -- using your own Approach scores, Skills, and Fighting 
    Styles.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Volume 2 Abilities

At the start of Volume 2, choose an ability from this list or the Volume 1 list.

:::::::: {.ability-list .v2 } :::::::

More than Meets the Eye

:   Until you use one of your Vehicle Scene Power Words, your Unique
    Vehicle appears to be a completely normal, ordinary vehicle of its
    chosen type. At the end of each Crisis Countdown, your Unique
    Vehicle loses its *Revealed* status if was *Revealed* before.

    Once someone has used one of those Vehicle Scene Power
    Words, your Vehicle is *Revealed* until the current Crisis is 
    resolved, and every hero or character in this Crisis is aware your 
    Vehicle is Unique and has special abilities.

    If your Vehicle hasn't been *Revealed*, add the Volume to the dice
    roll whenever you use one of the Vehicle Scene Power Words to roll
    to advance the Outwit goal. (Note that this will also *Reveal* your
    Vehicle, as described in the previous paragraph.)
