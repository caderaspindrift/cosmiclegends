# The Mage {#toc-mage .breakbefore .class}

> By the Blistering Bonds of Brathoon, be banished!

Mages wield a source of power that can be shaped into nearly
anything they can imagine. For a few this power is a gift bestowed
upon them, but all Mages spend time studying, perfecting, and
controlling their magicks.

## Playing a Mage

As a mage, your hero is likely one of the most powerful around.
Not only is it *very* easy to justify using the *Sorcery* Core
Power Word for nearly anything but your class ability,
*The Price of Magic*, increases the Effectiveness of your
rolls if you're willing to take the consequences of Edge
Successes.

And you *should* be willing to take those, because that's how
the Mage class plays. You've got a lot of magical power, but there's
a price to pay for it.

## Questions

As you create your Mage hero, answer any or all of these questions.

- All magic has a price -- so what was the *first* price you had to pay?
  What quality, talent, item, or relationship did you give up in order
  to gain magical power? Was it worth it?
- How do you cast your magical spells? Do you use an incantation, or
  merely gesture with your hand while envisioning the effect you'd
  like to produce?
- What does your magic look like? Is there a color associated with it?
  Are there common sounds, sights, or smells when you cast a spell?
  Are there types of magic you can't evoke?
- What master wizard instructed you? What price did *they* demand? 
  Did they have other students? Can you still ask your master for 
  advice?
- How do you view the world in a way that's different from heroes and
  others who aren't immersed in a magical mindset? What strange quirks
  do you have? What rituals do you follow that others couldn't possibly
  understand?
- What happens if your power gets out of your control?

## Skills

You have the **Historian** and  **Mystic** skills, plus two
additional skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of 
dice equal to the Volume.

## Class Ability: The Price of Magic

Word in a Power Stunt or Power Test, count 2s as Edge Successes in addition

- As a Power Display, costing no Might
- As a Power Stunt, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase.
