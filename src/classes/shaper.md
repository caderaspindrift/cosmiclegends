# The Shaper {#toc-shaper .breakbefore .class}

> Everyone wave goodbye to him! Get it? Wave. Because I control waves. Nobody? Tough crowd.

A Shaper is able to control some physical -- or quasi-physical --
substance, such as rock, water, or shadows. Their powers have 
a greater effect on the world around them than most heroes' do,
such as controlling the weather or leveling buildings with a 
glance.

## Playing a Shaper

Your Shaper hero focuses on two things: the type of matter you can
control, and the environment around you.

Each scene has several Scene Power Words that are chosen by the
Editor during the Countdown to Crisis. However, an Editor might
not think of everything -- so it's fine for you to suggest that
perhaps there might be a magazine stand on the street corner, for
example, if your hero controls paper.

One of the first things you're going to want to do is use your
*Reshape the Battlefield* ability to give yourself and the other
heroes Scene Power Words to use. Remember that a Scene Power Word
costs 0 Might to use! Reshaping at the start of a Crisis can 
save you a *lot* of Might in the long run!

## Other Element Power Words {#soapbox-other-element-power-words}

If you can think of something else you'd like your Shaper
hero to control, then choose that as your Element Power
Word instead! If you decide that your hero controls
dairy products, then go for it! If you need advice on
a good Word to pick, you can always ask the Editor and
other players for ideas.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
## Questions

As you create your Shaper hero, answer any or all of these questions.

::::::::::: questions ::::::::::::::::::::::
- How did you get these powers, and what limits do they have? 
  - Why can you control some types of matter and not others? 
  - Can you affect people with your powers, or are living 
    creatures beyond your control? 
- How much of your power is raw potential, and how much is rigid discipline? 
  - If you lost control, would you shut down or would you lash out?
- Can you generate your own element, or are you reliant upon having
  your element present to start shaping? 
- Do you view yourself as speaking to nature and asking for its
  aid, or as forcing the elements to bend to your will, or as an
  artist carefully sculpting exactly what you need from the world?
- What effect does your emotional state have on the environment?
  - How does the state of your environment affect *you*? 
- Are there any manifestations of your power that follow
  you around, and if so, can you exercise conscious control over them?
