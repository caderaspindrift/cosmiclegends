# Dual-Class Heroes

A Dual-Class Hero is one who can change between a *primary class*
and a *secondary class* form, and is likely a hero who looks 
different in each form. One might be a meek scientist while the
other a rampaging monster; one could be a young student while the
other is a dazzling magical star-princess.

Dual-Class Heroes are a way to build a hero who transforms to do 
their superheroic deeds, including magical girls and were-creatures.

When you create your Dual-Class Hero, you get to choose the following:

1. What they look like in their *primary class*.
2. What they look like in their *secondary class*.
3. How they change between *primary class* and *secondary class*,
   and how long that takes.
4. Their Class Abilities, Fighting Styles, Skills, and Personal
   Power Words for each class.

At the start of each Season, you choose a new Class Ability for each
of the two classes. Whenever you gain a new Fighting Style or
Skill, assign it to one of the two classes; it can only be used when
your hero is in that class or form.

Whenever you get to choose a new personal power word, choose one word
for each class and add it to the Personal Power Words for that form.
If your Health or Might advances, it applies to *both* class forms.

These stay consistent between *primary class* and *secondary class*
for the same hero:

1. The values for their Approaches. (Action, Adventure, Detective,
   Mystery, and Suspense.)
2. Their Ideals, and whether they've tagged their keys for each Ideal.
3. Their Season (which is consistent for the Series).
4. Their (maximum) Health and (maximum) Might.
5. Whether they've unlocked their Nova Power Words this Storyline,
   whether they're the Spotlight Hero, and their Advancements.

Switching from *primary* to *secondary* class does the following:
0. Costs 1 Might or 1 Health.
1. Resets their current Health to its maximum value.
2. Keeps their Might at its current level.

Switching from *secondary* to *primary* class does the following:
0. Costs 1 Might or 1 Health.
1. Resets their current Might to its maximum value.
2. Keeps their Health at its current level.

# Character Sheets for Dual-Class Heroes

The easiest way to run a dual-class hero is just maintain two 
different character sheets, and flip between them when the 
character changes form/class!
