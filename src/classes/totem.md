# The Totem {#toc-totem .breakbefore .class}

> The power of my totem beast strengthens my body to give me the
  power I need to fight for justice.

That's all they say you are. Created in a lab, created by other
people, originally from non-living material.

Do **your** origins make **you** any *less* of a person than I am?

You're more than just a simple gadget or toy. You've found there
is more to being a person than simply being born human or looking
like they do.

## Playing a Totem

Your hero is really, really good at breaking things. 

You're going to want to advance the Smash goal whenever you can, but keep in
mind that you're more than *just* muscle. 

You have Skills, Abilities, and possibly other Power Words that you can use 
to switch up your moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.

## Questions

As you create your Totem hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::
- How do you look different from normal humans? 
  - How much larger are you than other people? 
  - What color is your skin, and what does it feel like? 
  - What kind of strange appearance do you have that
    makes the ignorant assume you're a mere brute? 
  - What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do you employ?
- Are you *always* a monster?  
  (You may want to consider playing your hero as <a href="#toc-multi-class">Multi-Class Hero</a>.)
  - If not, what triggers that change? 
  - Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, or your own free will? 
  - Will people not like you when you're angry? Why not?
  - *Were* you always a monster?
- What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people? 
  - Are you an artist at heart, a scientist, a poet, a doctor, a pilot? 
- Why *aren't* you the monster they say you are? 
  - What makes you a *hero* and not a villain or mindless threat? 
  - What would push you over that edge, and how have you avoided going 
    over it so far?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Skills

You have the **Engineer** and **Hacker** skills, plus two additional
skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses one of your skills, add 1 extra die. If
you have more than one skill that could apply to a roll, add 1 extra die for each
applicable skill.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until it is off cooldown.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Synthetic** and **Sentience**.
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt

by paying 1 Might for each beyond the first.

Choose any two single words you like; these are your **Nova Power Words**.
When you check off all your Ideals, your Nova Power Words are **Unlocked**
until the end of the current Storyline.
