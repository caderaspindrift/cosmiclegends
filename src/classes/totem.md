## Totem Abilities {.class}

Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class.
Your Totem abilities show your 
increasing identification with your totem nature and distance
from humanity.
Each ability can be chosen only once.

### Prime Ability

Your hero has the **Does Whatever a Totem Can** Prime ability common 
to all Totem heroes.

:::::: {.ability-list .prime }::::::::::
Does Whatever a Totem Can

:   When you use your Core or Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt
    or Combo roll, add 2 dice to as if you had a skill or fighting
    style that applies to such a use. If you have a normal skill
    or fighting style that could apply to a roll, only add the
    bonus dice from your *Does Whatever a Totem Can* Ability.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Volume 1 Abilities

At the start of Volume 1, choose two abilities from this list.

::::: {.ability-list .v1 } ::::::::::

Animal Partner

:   You have an unusually intelligent pet or companion that accompanies
    you on your heroic adventures. This partner has three Core Power Words --
    one matching your Totem Nature Power Word, and two others from the
    Totem Personal Power Words List -- that you can use for free without
    spending Might, each once per Hero Phase. Your animal partner's 
    Health and Might equal the Volume.

    Choose one Skill possessed by your Animal Partner, and a Fighting
    Style. You can use that skill or Fighting Style whenever your 
    Animal Partner is present during a Crisis.

    During any Hero Phase, either your hero can make a move or your
    animal partner can make a move -- not both.

    This is a *Pet* Ability.

    *Prerequisite: The __Mystic Totem__ class ability.* 
    If your animal partner is ever killed, they return to life at the 
    end of the next Crisis Countdown, and join you as soon as they
    can.

Unbeatable

:   Your humble powers cause people to under-estimate you and you 
    actually can punch punch far above your normal weight class.
    Whenever you have one or more companions of the same type as your
    Totem Nature Power Word present -- including from the *Animal Companion* 
    or *Summon Swarm* class abilities -- add 1 to the Effectiveness of any 
    roll you make to advance any goal.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Volume 2 Abilities

At the start of Volume 2, choose an ability from this list or the Volume 1 list.

:::::::: {.ability-list .v2 } :::::::

All Animals Love Me. Really. I Wouldn't Make Something Like That Up.

:    When you roll to advance the Allay goal and the source of
     the Crisis is an animal, or when you roll to advance the
     Rescue goal and animals are endangered, add 2 to the
     Effectiveness of the roll.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: cpw :::::::
#### Totem Core Power Words

Alien Pet

    Your pet or animal partner isn't from Earth -- or might not even be from 
    this universe, in the case of a magical pet.

    [Monstrosity, Totem]{.crossover .es}
    Whenever you choose a Core Power Word for your Pet, you can choose 
    from the Monstrosity Class Personal Power Words List or the
    Paragon Class Personal Power Words List. 
    These become Core Power
    Words that you can use for free, once per Hero Phase, as described 
    in the *Pet* or *Animal Partner* class abilities.
    
    This is __not__ a *Pet* Ability.

Intelligent Pet

:   *Prerequisite: You must have a __Pet__ Ability.*
    Your pet is smarter than an average animal of that type. It can
    communicate intelligently in one language that you choose when
    you pick this class ability, although its voice is clearly
    non-human. 

    In addition, pick a second Skill possessed by the Pet, and one Approach. 
    Whenever your Pet is present at a Crisis, add 3 dice whenever you make a roll 
    using the chosen Approach.

    This is __not__ a *Pet* Ability.

Magical Familiar

:   *Prerequisite: You must have a __Pet__ Ability.*
    Whenever you choose a Core Power Word for your Pet, you can
    choose from the Divine Class's Personal Power Words List, the
    Hellspawn Class's Personal Power Words List, or the
    Mage Class Personal Power Words List. 

    [Divine, Mage]{.crossover .es}
    These become Core Power Words that you can use for free, 
    each once per Hero Phase, as described in the *Pet* class ability.

    If your Magical Familiar is ever killed, they return to life at 
    the end of the next Crisis Countdown, and join you as soon as they
    can.

    This is __not__ a *Pet* Ability.

Pet

:   *Prerequisite: You can't have another __Pet__ Ability.*
    You have an unusually intelligent pet or companion that accompanies
    you on your heroic adventures. 

    This partner has three Core Power Words --
    one chosen from the Totem Class's Totem Nature Power Words List,
    and two others from the Totem Class's Personal Power Words List -- 
    that you can use for free without spending Might, each once per Hero 
    Phase. Your animal partner's Health and Might equal the Volume.

    Choose one Skill possessed by your Animal Partner, and a Fighting
    Style. You can use that skill or Fighting Style whenever your 
    Animal Partner is present during a Crisis.

    During any Hero Phase, either your hero can make a move or your
    animal partner can make a move -- not both.

    This is a *Pet* Ability.
