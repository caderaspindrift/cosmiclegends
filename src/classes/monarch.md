# The Monarch  {#toc-monarch .breakbefore .class}

> I shall forgive you but once for your disrespect.

You are a leader in a city, nation, or people who exist outside of
mainstream international society. 

Your ways may seem unorthodox and even arrogant to those unfamiliar
with your culture, but their ignorance can be excused ... mostly.

Although you fight for justice and freedom for all, you feel a special
obligation to protect your home -- even if you don't currently live
there.

## Playing a Monarch

Your Monarch hero is most strongly defined by their home than by their
Powers, Approaches, or Skills. You're most effective against threats
against that home. 

It's up to you to decide if any given Crisis endangers your domain, 
so you may want to ask the Editor or other players during the Countdown
to Crisis about ideas to tie your home to the current situation.

## Questions

As you create your Monarch hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions ::::::::::::::::::::::
- Where is your home located? 
  - How does its location serve to isolate it from other cultures? 
  - Is your home open to outsiders, or sealed off?
- What kind of distinct cultural traditions from your home could be seen as
  strange to outsiders? 
  - And conversely, what Western customs are either
    baffling or unacceptable to you?
- Which languages are spoken in your home? 
  - Do the people of your home know any languages of outsiders? 
  - Is there a particular accent common to your people?
- Are your powers common to everyone from your home, or are you unique?
  - Do your powers descend from your lineage? 
  - Do you have additional abilities based on your rank as a leader?
- What's your current status in your home? 
  - Do you live there? 
  - Are you the reigning monarch, or an heir in line for the throne? 
  - If you're not the monarch regnant, who is, and how do you feel 
    about each other? 
  - Have you been exiled from your home, and if so -- for what reason?

## Cultural Sensitivity {#soapbox-cultural-sensitivity}

You can define any details you like about your Monarch's
home. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't be aware of
real-world stereotypes, bigotries, and privilege.

Your Monarch's home is *never* somewhere that exists --
or could exists -- in the real world. You can live on the
Moon, or in the Antarctic, or under the Pacific Ocean, or
in an adjacent dimension, or on a floating city -- but you
can't be the Monarch of China or Uganda or Pittsburgh.

Check in regularly with your fellow players and the Editor
to make sure that you're not straying into problematic
stereotypes, including accents, as you play your Monarch.

## Monarch Abilities {.class}

Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class.
Your Monarch Abilities represent esoteric knowledge that
is inaccessible to those outside of your home.
Each ability can be chosen only once.

### Prime Ability

Your hero has the **For My Kingdom!** Prime ability common 
to all Monarchs.

:::::: {.ability-list .prime }::::::::::
For My Kingdom!

:   You feel a special attachment to your homeland, whether it be
    a physical location or a metaphorical concept such as "the Seas".

    If you declare a Crisis threatens your domain, whenever
    you form or add to the Teamwork Pool add 2 extra dice.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Volume 1 Abilities

At the start of Volume 1, choose two abilities from this list.

::::::: {.ability-list .v1 } ::::::::
Exotic Weaponry

:   []{.arsenal-prereq}
    The weapons from your home use a technology that defies
    conventional explanation. 

    At the start of each Storyline, pick a number of Power Words
    from the Dynamo or Mage Personal Power Words lists
    equal to the Volume.

    You can use each Power Word as a Core Power Word once
    during the current Storyline without paying any Might.

    []{.arsenal-id}

Loyal Subjects

:   *Note: This is a variant of the __Dependable Allies__ Generic
    Ability.*
    You have a network of citizens upon whom you can rely for help. While
    they're not quite at the level of a Knight or an Expert, they all have
    at least one special talent that assists you in fighting crime, and are
    sworn to keep your secrets (if you have any).

    Included with this Ability is a reliable and discreet way to contact your
    subjects. As a Move during the Hero Phase of a Crisis, you can spend 1 Might
    to contact one or all of your Loyal Subjects.

    When you first gain this Ability, create a list of subjects, with a number of
    entries on the list equal to the Volume. Add an additional subject before each
    subsequent Volume.

    Each subject is defined by three qualities: First, their name. Secondly, their
    favored Approach. And thirdly, a Skill that defines their expertise and/or
    "day job."

    For example, you could create a photojournalist named James Bartholomew and
    assign him "Action" as a favored Approach, and Journalist as his skill.

    Any subject you call in has a score of 1 for all Approaches save their favored
    Approach (which is a 4), a maximum Might score equal to the Volume, and a
    maximum Health score equal to the Volume.

    Without spending any Might to contact one or more Loyal Subjects, you
    can freely propose a Vignette between your Hero and one of your Subjects.

Noblesse Oblige

:   You feel an obligation to protect the ordinary people of the world. 

    Add 2 to the dice pool to advance the Rescue goal. 
    If the bystanders are from your kingdom, also add the Volume to the dice 
    pool.

Remote Palace

:   []{.herocave-prereq}

    You have a hidden base of operations somewhere in your distant monarchy. 

    Add 2 dice whenever you make a skill roll while in your Palace.

    Choose two Scene Power Words for your Palace from
    [](#generic-hero-cave-power-words){.list-link}. 
    In addition, a third Scene Power Word for your Palace from the
    [](#monarch-class-scene-power-words){.list-link .nopage}:

    Prime Ability:  *Strengthen the Kingdom:*

    ::::::::::: box-it :::::::::::::::::::
    Strengthen the Kingdom
    :    When you use your
         Core or Nova Power Words in a Power Display, Stunt, or Combo, 
         you can count 5s as two successes instead of 1.
         If you do, lose either 1 Health or 1 Might after your roll, 
         regardless of how many extra successes you gained.
    ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Monarch's Benevolence

:   Your favor is freely bestowed as a boon to those in need.
    Add 2 to the dice pool when you advance the Allay goal.

    connection to the land.
