# The Monarch  {#toc-monarch .breakbefore .class}

> I shall forgive you but once for your disrespect.

You are a leader in a city, nation, or people who exist outside of
mainstream international society. 

Your ways may seem unorthodox and even arrogant to those unfamiliar
with your culture, but their ignorance can be excused ... mostly.

Although you fight for justice and freedom for all, you feel a special
obligation to protect your home -- even if you don't currently live
there.

## Playing a Monarch

Your Monarch hero is most strongly defined by their home than by their
Powers, Approaches, or Skills. You're most effective against threats
against that home. 

It's up to you to decide if any given Crisis endangers your domain, 
so you may want to ask the Editor or other players during the Countdown
to Crisis about ideas to tie your home to the current situation.

## Questions

As you create your Monarch hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions ::::::::::::::::::::::
- Where is your home located? 
  - How does its location serve to isolate it from other cultures? 
  - Is your home open to outsiders, or sealed off?
- What kind of distinct cultural traditions from your home could be seen as
  strange to outsiders? 
  - And conversely, what Western customs are either
    baffling or unacceptable to you?
- Which languages are spoken in your home? 
  - Do the people of your home know any languages of outsiders? 
  - Is there a particular accent common to your people?
- Are your powers common to everyone from your home, or are you unique?
  - Do your powers descend from your lineage? 
  - Do you have additional abilities based on your rank as a leader?
- What's your current status in your home? 
  - Do you live there? 
  - Are you the reigning monarch, or an heir in line for the throne? 
  - If you're not the monarch regnant, who is, and how do you feel 
    about each other? 
  - Have you been exiled from your home, and if so -- for what reason?

## Cultural Sensitivity

You can define any details you like about your Monarch's
home. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't be aware of
real-world stereotypes, bigotries, and privilege.

Your Monarch's home is *never* somewhere that exists --
or could exists -- in the real world. You can live on the
Moon, or in the Antarctic, or under the Pacific Ocean, or
in an adjacent dimension, or on a floating city -- but you
can't be the Monarch of China or Uganda or Pittsburgh.

Check in regularly with your fellow players and the Editor
to make sure that you're not straying into problematic
stereotypes, including accents, as you play your Monarch.
