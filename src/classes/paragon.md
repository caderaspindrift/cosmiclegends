# The Paragon  {#toc-paragon .breakbefore .class}

[]{.lorem}

These examples will be removed:

- Examples: Supergirl, Superman, Captain Marvel, Martian Manhunter

## Skills

You have two skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of 
dice equal to the current Volume.

## Class Ability: My One Weakness!

When you create your hero, pick a weakness they possess --
usually some kind of substance, energy type, or other physical
phenomenon.

During a Crisis, you can declare at any point that your one 
weakness is present.  

If you do, you temporarily lose access to *all* of your Power Words, 
your Might becomes 0,
and you skip your turn during the Hero Turn. This lasts until someone
else removes the source of your weakness from the scene, or until 
the end of the present Crisis.

Every Hero Turn that you're inactive, the other heroes get extra
dice on their rolls equal to the Volume number.

When the source of your weakness is disposed of, you regain access
to all your Power Words and your Might is refreshed to its normal
maximum value.

## Power Words

by paying 1 Might for each beyond the first.

### Nova Power

Choose any two single words you like; these are your **Nova Power Words**.
When you complete your Motivations track, your Nova Power Words are **Unlocked**
until the end of the current Story Arc.
