# The Paragon  {#toc-paragon .breakbefore .class}

> I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that.

You're convinced that your powers are meant to help others,
not for your own benefit. You protect those who can't defend
themselves, help those who can't help themselves.

You're the epitome of a hero. Flight, strength, invulnerability,
and superhuman verions of normal human abilities are common
among Paragons, along with the odd random power usually found
in another class.

## Playing a Paragon

If you're playing a Paragon because you want to revel in your
hero's power ... then you're probably playing the wrong class.

Paragons, despite often being the most powerful heroes 
*in concept*, are primarily support heroes. The class
ability -- *My One Weakness!* -- takes your hero out of the
fight but gives a boost to the other heroes!

Your Paragon may have more Health than other heroes -- but
that's because, ideally, you're using Take the Hit whenever you
possibly can. Paragons are about protecting others first, and
punching villains a distant second.

Also, look for creative ways to use your *Powers* and *Abilities* 
Core Power Words -- they can justify any number of ad hoc power 
uses in combination with your other Power Words, such 
as *Vision Powers* or *Alien Abilities*. What do those mean? Whatever
you say they mean!

## Questions

As you create your Paragon hero, answer any or all of these questions.

- Why do normal people love you instead of fearing your power?  
  - Why do *you* love humanity so much?
  - Do you wear a mask, or can everyone see your face? 
  - Do you have a cape? If not, why not? 
- What normal humans keep you grounded when you can fly so much 
  higher than mere mortals? 
  - Who taught you that you have a responsibility to others? 
  - Do you ever adopt a disguise to pass as a normal human?  
  - How do you deal with so much weight on your shoulders? 
  - Who else do you rely on for assistance?
- Are there other people like you? 
  - Do you have an arch-enemy who
    uses your best qualities to harm others instead of helping them?
- Why *haven't* you used your powers to make huge changes in the
  world? 
  - What holds you back from ruling over humanity for its
    own good? 
  - What kind of nightmares wake you up in the middle of
    the night, frightened by your own potential to break the world?
  - Who can be trusted to stop you if you're not in control of yourself?

## Skills

You have two skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of 
dice equal to the Volume.

## Class Ability: My One Weakness!

When you create your hero, pick a weakness they possess --
usually some kind of substance, energy type, or other physical
phenomenon.

During a Crisis, you can declare at any point that your one 
weakness is present.  

If you do, you temporarily lose access to *all* of your Power Words, 
your Might becomes 0, and you skip your turn during the Hero Turn. 
This lasts until someone else removes the source of your weakness 
from the scene, or until the end of the present Crisis.

Every Hero Turn that you're inactive, the other heroes get extra
dice on their rolls equal to the Volume number.

When the source of your weakness is disposed of, you regain access
to all your Power Words and your Might is refreshed to its normal
maximum value.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a Power Display, costing no Might
- As a Power Stunt, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a Power Combo, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a Power Combo, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Powers** and **Abilities**. 
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo,
or 2 Might to add both.

### Personal Power Words

Choose six Personal Power Words from the following list:

::::::::::: cpw ::::::::::::::::
- Alien
- Blast
- Breath
- Cape 
- Cold
- Energy
- Flight
- Heat
- Indestructible
- Punch
- Speed
- Strength
- Thoughts
- Vision
- X-Ray
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In addition, choose one Power Word from any other class's Personal Power Words list.

When you use a **Power Display,** you can add one Personal Power Word for free.

You can use two Power Personal Words together to form a **Power Stunt** or **Power Combo**
by paying 1 Might for each beyond the first.

### Nova Power

Choose any two single words you like; these are your **Nova Power Words**.
When you check off all your Ideals, your Nova Power Words are **Unlocked**
until the end of the current Storyline.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt or Combo for free; if you spend
1 Might, you can include the second Nova Power Word as well.
