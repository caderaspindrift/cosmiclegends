## Questions

As you create your Paragon hero, answer any or all of these questions.

- []{.lorem}
- []{.lorem}

## Skills

You have two skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of 
dice equal to the Volume.

## Class Ability: My One Weakness!

When you create your hero, pick a weakness they possess --
usually some kind of substance, energy type, or other physical
phenomenon.

During a Crisis, you can declare at any point that your one 
weakness is present.  

If you do, you temporarily lose access to *all* of your Power Words, 
your Might becomes 0, and you skip your turn during the Hero Turn. 
This lasts until someone else removes the source of your weakness 
from the scene, or until the end of the present Crisis.

Every Hero Turn that you're inactive, the other heroes get extra
dice on their rolls equal to the Volume number.

When the source of your weakness is disposed of, you regain access
to all your Power Words and your Might is refreshed to its normal
maximum value.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a Power Display, costing no Might
- As a Power Stunt, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a Power Combo, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a Power Combo, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Powers** and **Abilities**. 
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo,
or 2 Might to add both.

### Personal Power Words

Choose *seven* (not six) Personal Power Words from the following list:

::::::::::: cpw ::::::::::::::::
- Alien
- Blast
- Breath
- Cape 
- Cold
- Energy
- Flight
- Heat
- Indestructible
- Punch
- Speed
- Strength
- Thoughts
- Vision
- X-Ray
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In addition, choose one Power Word from any other class's Personal Power Words list.

When you use a **Power Display,** you can add one Personal Power Word for free.

You can use two Power Personal Words together to form a **Power Stunt** or **Power Combo**
by paying 1 Might for each beyond the first.

### Nova Power

Choose any two single words you like; these are your **Nova Power Words**.
When you check off all your Ideals, your Nova Power Words are **Unlocked**
until the end of the current Storyline.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt or Combo for free; if you spend
1 Might, you can include the second Nova Power Word as well.

## Paragon Abilities {  .class}

Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class.
Your Paragon Abilities reflect new uses for your vast array
of super-powers.
