# The Psychic {#toc-psychic .breakbefore .class}

> I know secrets about you that you don't even know yourself.

Psychics are masters of mind powers, able to communicate
with others and link minds together.

Their powers are often purely mental without a physical
manifestation; a duel between two Psychics could take place
in the middle of a crowded restaurant with no one any the
wiser.

If normal people knew that a Psychic was among them -- and could 
potentially access their innermost thoughts and desires! --
they would react with fear and hostility. Some Psychics will
pose as some other type of hero to avoid such prejudices ... even
as they admit such biases might not be entirely unwarranted.

## Playing a Psychic

Your Psychic hero is likely the lynchpin of the team, although
not necessarily the leader. This is a passive ability, though --
unless you choose otherwise, everyone's connected when you're
present -- so look for ways to use your own Power Words, Skills,
and Abilities in creative and original ways.

## No Ethical Mind Control Under Capitalism

Many comic books and roleplaying games will gloss over
it, but I'll state it directly: nearly any use of mind
control powers represents gross violations of another
person's autonomy and consent.

This doesn't mean you can't *ever* do that in an Issue
of []{.gamename}, but it means that you have to be careful
and safe by checking in with the other players and the
Editor -- because your Psychic hero is probably doing
something that's quite horrific if you're using mind
control.

During Issue 0 or the start of an Issue, you should ask
the other players and the Editor about whether they view
reading someone's mind without consent as the same kind
of violation. Are surface thoughts fine, but deep memories
not? 

You *need* to have these kinds of talks, as a group,
*before* it comes up during game play.

## Questions

As you create your Psychic hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::
- How do you come by these amazing mental powers? 
  - What kind of training or education did you undertake to master them?
- Are there obvious signs to your powers, such as an enlarged forehead,
  glowing eyes, or a visible crackle of power -- or are they completely
  invisible and undetectable?
- What limits have you imposed on your own power due to ethical and
  moral concerns? 
  - What type of actions won't you take, and what would
    push you to actually commit those acts? 
  - What makes you a *hero* and not
    a mind-powered villain, looting others' skulls with impunity?
- What kind of mental self-image do you have?
  - Does your telepathic voice "sound" like your *physical* voice? 
  - Do others recognize you when you make mental contact with you? 
- Do you have any *physical* limitations, such as a disability? 
  - How do your powers compensate for those limits, and in what ways can
    they never fully substitute for them?

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of

    advance the Allay goal, as long as you have at least 1 Might.

Mind Over Matter

    projection.
    You can awaken at any time, and if you do, your mind is drawn
    back to your body instantly. You automatically awaken if your
    physical body is harmed or you are roughly shaken.
    While astrally projecting, you are immune to all harm and can
    pass through any barriers. You can use any of your Psychic
    Class Abilities, Personal Power Words, Core Power Words, and
    your Nova Power Words.
    In astral form, you have "Flight" as a Core Power Word. You can
    choose whether your astral form is visible to those in the same
    location, or if it is invisible to all creatures lacking
