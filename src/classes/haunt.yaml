    The happy haunts have received your sympathetic vibrations and are beginning 
    to materialize. They’re assembling for a swinging wake, and they’ll be 
    expecting me… I’ll see you all a little later.
- desc: |
    You're dead.

    Sorry about the bad news.

    But for whatever reason ... you are cursed to walk the Earth, 
    along that narrow line between life and death.
- playing: |
    You have Skills, Abilities, and possibly other Power Words that 
    you can use to switch up your moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.
- questions:
  - "How do you look different from normal humans?":
    - "How much larger (or smaller) are you than other people?"
    - "What color is your skin, and what does it feel and look like?"
    - "What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do you employ?"
  - "Are you *always* a Ghost?":
    - "(If not, then you may want to consider playing your hero as a
       <a href=\"#toc-multi-class\">Multi-Class Hero</a> -- this is appropriate for heroes who magically transform from living form to a ghostly shape!)"
    - "If not, what triggers that change?":
      - "Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, a magic word, or your own free will?"
  - "Why do you still walk the Earth?":
    - "What (or who) prevents you from moving on to an afterlife?"
    - "How can your spirit finally be laid to rest?"
    - "Would your hero take that opportunity to move on, or fight against it?"
