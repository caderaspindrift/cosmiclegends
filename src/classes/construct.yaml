    "Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics:
    
    I must not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
    being to come to harm.

    I must obey orders given to me by human beings, except where such orders
    would conflict with the previous law.

    I must protect my own existence as long as such protection does not
    conflict with the previous two laws."

    That's all they say you are. Created in a lab, created by other
    people, originally from non-living material.

    Who *doesn't* that describe? Spoiler: humans are all created by other
    humans.

    Do **your** origins make **you** any *less* of a person than anyone else?

    You're more than just a simple gadget or toy. You've found there
    is more to being a person than simply being born human or looking
    like they do."
