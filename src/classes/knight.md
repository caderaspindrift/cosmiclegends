# The Knight  {#toc-knight .breakbefore .class}

> Hh.

Most other heroes -- with the exception of some Inventors -- have
superhuman powers and abilities. You're not like them. Your own
training and talents are what made you what you are: you may have a
minor super-power, you may have high-tech devices, but ultimately 
it comes down to your skill against someone else's.

## Playing a Knight

When you play your Knight hero, come up with ways to use your
Power Words that reflect your normal abilities instead of any
superpowers you possess. Other heroes -- such as the Dynamo or
the Paragon -- focus on their powers, but you rely on your
Skills, your specialized tools, and your Fighting Styles.

You *can* combine your Fighting Styles with each other and with
your Power Words, so look for synergies there -- nearly every
Knight has a *Weapon* Power Word for that reason. If you pick
*Weapon* (or *Vehicle*), name the general kind of weapon --
Rifle, Boomerang, Sword, Shield, and so on.

If you're going to play a more realistic hero, consider the
*Weapons Locker* Ability for access to more weapon Power Words, and
devote your own Personal Power Words to expanding the variety
of effects you can produce.

## Questions

As you create your Knight hero, answer any or all of these questions.

::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::
- Why are you *so* driven? 
  - Which of your ideals were strong enough to make you 
    devote so much time toward developing your talents? 
  - Did someone hurt you or you those you love, or
    are you motivated by a patroitic or professional calling?
- What kinds of gear do you use? 
  - How do you carry those -- a quiver, a belt, a backpack, or 
    pouches all over your costume?
  - Are your weapons and devices completely mundane, are they
    the result of unrealistic super-science, or are they supernatural
    in origin? 
  - Did you create them, or did someone else?
- Do you have any powers, and if so, how did you come by them?
  - In what ways can you combine those with your more mundane talents?
- Who trained you, and why? 
  - Are they still in your life, in some way? 
  - Are you on good or bad terms with them?
  - Did you learn from one person, or from multiple masters? 
  - Did your instructor(s) have other students,
    and if so, how do you relate to each of them?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Skills

You have the **Criminal**, **Investigator**, and **Spy** skills, plus four
additional skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, add 2 dice to the Dice Pool.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, cost of no Might
- As a **Power Stunt**, cost of 1 Might (no Might if a Core Power Word, Nova Power Word, or Scene Power Word) for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, cost of 1 Might (no Might if a Core Power Word, Nova Power Word, or Scene Power Word) and letting others potentially join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might (no Might if a Core Power Word, Nova Power Word, or Scene Power Word).

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Prepared** and **Gambit**.
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo,
or 2 Might to add both.

### Knight Class Personal Power Words

Choose five Personal Power Words from the following list:

::::::::::: cpw :::::::::::::::::
# [Knight Class Personal Power Words](#knight-class-personal-power-words)

- Acrobat
- Aim
- Armor
- Fear
- Fearless
- Hidden
- Improvised
- Line
- Photographic
- Remove
- Ricochet
- Sense
- Shield
- Snare
- Throw
- Unerring

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you use a **Power Display,** you can add one Personal Power Word for free.

You can use two Power Personal Words together to form a **Power Stunt** or **Power Combo**
by paying 1 Might for each beyond the first.

### Nova Power

Choose any two or three single words you like; these are your 
**Nova Power Words**.

At the start of any Storyline, your Nova Power Words are **Locked** and
you can't use them in Power Displays, Stunts, or Combos.

When you mark all your Ideals, your Nova Power Words are **Unlocked**
until the end of the current Storyline.

You can use one of your *Unlocked* Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt 
or Combo for free; if you spend 1 Might, you can include a second 
Nova Power Word as well.

You can use one or more of your *Locked* Nova Power Words in a Power 
Display, Stunt, or Combo by spending 1 Might per Nova Power Word. 
The Nova Power Word remains *Locked*.

to all Knights.
