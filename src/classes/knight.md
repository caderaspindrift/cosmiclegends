# The Knight  {#toc-knight .breakbefore .class}

> Hh.

Most other heroes -- with the exception of some Inventors -- have
superhuman powers and abilities. You're not like them. Your own
training and talents are what made you what you are; you may have
powers, you may have high-tech devices, but ultimately it comes
down to your skill against someone else's.

## Playing a Knight

When you play your Knight hero, come up with ways to use your
Power Words that reflect your normal abilities instead of any
superpowers you possess. Other heroes -- such as the Dynamo or
the Paragon -- focus on their powers, but you rely on your
Skills, your specialized tools, and your Fighting Styles.

You *can* combine your Fighting Styles with each other and with
your Power Words, so look for synergies there -- nearly every
Knight has a *Weapon* Power Word for that reason. If you pick
*Weapon* (or *Vehicle*), name the general kind of weapon --
Rifle, Boomerang, Sword, Shield, and so on.

If you're going to play a more realistic hero, consider the
*Weapons Locker* ability for access to weapon Power Words, and
devote your own Personal Power Words to expanding the variety
of effects you can produce.

## Questions

As you create your Knight hero, answer any or all of these questions.

::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::
- Why are you *so* driven? 
  - Which of your ideals were strong enough to make you 
    devote so much time toward developing your talents? 
  - Did someone hurt you or you those you love, or
    are you motivated by a patroitic or professional calling?
- What kinds of gear do you use? 
  - How do you carry those -- a quiver, a belt, a backpack, or 
    pouches all over your costume?
  - Are your weapons and devices completely mundane, are they
    the result of unrealistic super-science, or are they supernatural
    in origin? 
  - Did you create them, or did someone else?
- Do you have any powers, and if so, how did you come by them?
  - In what ways can you combine those with your more mundane talents?
- Who trained you, and why? 
  - Are you on good or bad terms with them?
  - Are they still in your life? 
  - Did you learn from one person, or from multiple masters? 
  - Did your instructor(s) have other students,
    and if so, how do you relate to each of them?
