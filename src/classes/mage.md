# The Mage {#toc-mage .breakbefore .class}

> By the Blistering Bonds of Brathoon, be banished!

Mages wield a source of power that can be shaped into nearly
anything they can imagine. For a few this power is a gift bestowed
upon them, but all Mages spend time studying, perfecting, and
controlling their magicks.

## Playing a Mage

As a mage, your hero is likely one of the most powerful around.
Not only is it *very* easy to justify using the *Sorcery* Core
Power Word for nearly anything but your class ability,
*The Price of Magic*, increases the Effectiveness of your
rolls if you're willing to take the consequences of Edge
Successes.

And you *should* be willing to take those, because that's how
the Mage class plays. You've got a lot of magical power, but there's
a price to pay for it.

## Questions

As you create your Mage hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::
- All magic has a price -- so what was the *first* price you had to pay?
  - What quality, talent, item, or relationship did you give up in order
    to gain magical power? 
  - Was it worth it?
- How do you cast your magical spells? 
  - Do you use an incantation, or
    merely gesture with your hand while envisioning the effect you'd
    like to produce?
- What does your magic look like? 
  - Is there a color associated with it?
  - Are there common sounds, sights, or smells when you cast a spell?
- Are there types of magic you can't evoke?
- What master wizard instructed you? 
  - What price did *they* demand? 
  - Did they have other students? 
  - Can you still ask your master for advice?
- How do you view the world in a way that's different from heroes and
  others who aren't immersed in a magical mindset? 
  - What strange quirks do you have? 
  - What rituals do you follow that others couldn't possibly
    understand?
- What happens if your power gets out of your control?

## Mage Abilities {  .class}

Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class.
Your Mage Abilities are new ways of calling upon arcane power.
Each ability can be chosen only once.

### Volume 1 Abilities

At the start of Volume 1, choose two abilities from this list.

::::::: {.ability-list .v1 } ::::::::

Auspicious Alliteration

:   Everyone enjoys euphonious enunciation! When you roll a Power Stunt
    or Power Combo to add to the Teamwork Pool, add 1 die to the dice pool 
    for each Word whose first letter matches the first letter of 
    another Word in the Stunt or Combo.

Mists of Misdirection

:   Your magicks can cloud the minds of mortals. Add 2 dice when you use
    a power to advance the Outwit or Rescue goals.

Sanctuary of Sanctity

:   You have a base of operations hidden in a normal-looking building
    or tower. When you make a skill roll in that building, add 2
    to the dice pool.

Theurgy

:   Your magic is grounded in the magic of the Gods themselves.
    Choose one Power Word from the Divine Class Personal Power 
    Word List as a Core Power Word.

    You have a variant of the Divine Class Prime Ability
    *_Give Me Strength!_*: *Invoke the Divine.*

    When you use your Core or Nova Power Words in a Power
    Stunt or Combo, you can count 6s as two successes 
    instead of 1. If you do, lose either 1 Health or 1
    Might after your roll, regardless of how many extra
    successes you gained.

    Instead of choosing a Volume 2 Mage Ability, you can
    choose a Volume 2 or lower Ability from the Divine
    Class. *Weapon of the Gods (1st)*, 
    *Speed of Hermes (2nd)* and
    *Skill of Artemis (3rd)* are among the most applicable
    Divine Class Abilities to consider.
    
Thinking with Portals

    during the current Storyline without paying any Might.

Diabloist

:   Much of your power is drawn from the pits of Hell and

    You have a variant of the Hellspawn Class's Prime
    Ability *Infernal Wrath*: *Hellish Rebuke.*

    you can choose a Hellspawn Class Ability of the same
    Volume or lower.
