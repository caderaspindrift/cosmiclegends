# The Dynamo {#toc-dynamo .breakbefore .class}

> Stand back, everyone. This one's gonna hurt.

You're a living source of energy. Whether you generate it
yourself or tap into another plane of existence, you can use
that energy as a blast, an explosion, a punch, and more.

## Playing a Dynamo

This makes you especially good at blowing things up; in fights, you
use up Might quickly, but regain it almost as quickly. Dynamo is one
of the few classes that gets a third Core Power Word, so use that
to increase your dice pools by spending Might freely.

## Questions

As you create your Dynamo hero, answer any or all of these questions.

::::::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::
- What type of energy do you use? 
  - Do you produce it yourself, or does it come from another source? 
  - How exactly did you gain your power to use this energy?
- What visual, audible, and olfactory signatures accompany your power?
  - Is there a color associated with this energy, like silver, purple, or
    gold? Do you crackle with energy? 
  - An earth-shattering kaboom when your
    power goes off, a simple "ZOT" or something else? 
  - A burnt smell, or ozone, or petrichor?
- How does your hero feel about these powers? 
  - Do you revel in them, happy to show off? 
  - Or are you more restrained, afraid to let loose with your full strength? 
  - Have your powers ever harmed anyone else?

## Skills

You have the Scientist skill, plus any two skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of 
dice equal to the Volume.

## Other Energy Power Words {#soapbox-other-energy-power-words}

If you've got an idea for another type of energy,
go for it! You can run it past the Editor for ideas,
but if you say your energy is "thunder", for example,
then your power's thunder!

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Power Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
