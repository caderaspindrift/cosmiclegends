# The Inventor {#toc-inventor .breakbefore .class}

> I've been itching to try out these new modifications in the field!

Other heroes may have been born with power, inherited power, or been
changed by power -- but you *built* your own power with your own
hand(s).

Whether you have a set of standard equipment, wear a powered suit of armor,
or create whatever you need on the fly, your creations and Skills are more
important than your own powers -- if you even have any.

## Playing an Inventor

Many Inventors tend toward support roles, and your ability to
add to the Teamwork Pool while advancing a goal reflects this.

Don't be afraid to use your Engineer, Hacker, Scientist, or
other skills in conjunction with your Power Words to represent
making on-the-fly adjustments to whatever gear you carry.

## Questions

As you create your Inventor hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions ::::::::::::::::::::::::
- What kind of gear do you use? 
  - How do you carry that equipment around with you? 
  - What do your inventions look like? 
  - Do you have a specialty or common themes that you tend to invent?
- What potential applications for your tech could improve the world if
  everyone had access to it? 
  - How could your inventions be used to make the world a worse place? 
  - What steps do you take to prevent that from happening? 
  - Why don't the authorities fully trust those steps?
  - In what way could your inventions be turned against you? 
  - What's your blind spot when it comes to the implications of 
    your own creations?
- How did you come by your technical talents? 
- What inspired you to create these inventions? 
  - Why are you the only person who can use your inventions to their full
    potential? 
  - Who helped you create these inventions,
    and how do they feel about you using them?
- How do you pay for your inventions? 
  - Are you publicly linked with your source of funding? 
  - Do you hold patents on any of your inventions?
  - Does anyone *else* hold patents on your inventions?

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
