# The Haunt {#toc-haunt .breakbefore .class}

> 

You're dead.

Sorry about the bad news.

But for whatever reason ... you are cursed to walk the Earth, along
the narrow line between life and death.

## Playing a Haunt

You have Skills, Abilities, and possibly other Power Words that 
you can use to switch up your moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.

## Questions

As you create your Haunt hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::
- How do you look different from normal humans? 
  - How much larger (or smaller) are you than other people? 
  - What color is your skin, and what does it feel and look like? 
  - What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do 
    you employ?
- Are you *always* a Ghost?  
  (If not, then you may want to consider playing your hero as 
   <a href="#toc-multi-class">Multi-Class Hero</a> -- this is appropriate
   for heroes who magically transform from child form to an adult shape!)
  - If not, what triggers that change? 
    Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, a magic word,
    or your own free will? 
  - Do you have any other friends your age, or do you just associate with
    adult heroes?
- Why do you still walk the Earth?
  - What (or who) prevents you from moving on to an afterlife?
  - How can your spirit finally be laid to rest?
  - Would your hero take the opportunity to move on, or fight against it?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Skills

You have the **Mystic** and **Historian** skills, plus two additional 
skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses one of your skills, add 1 extra die. 
If you have more than one skill that could apply to a roll, add 1 
extra die for each applicable skill.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until it is off cooldown.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **To** **Be** and **Determined**.
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt 
or Combo, 2 Might to add two, and 3 Might to add all three.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you use a **Power Display,** you can add one Personal Power Word for free.

You can use two Power Personal Words together to form a **Power Stunt** 
or **Power Combo** by paying 1 Might for each beyond the first.

### Nova Power

Choose at least two but no more than four single words you like; 
these are your **Nova Power Words**, and together are known as your
**Nova Power Phrase**.

When you mark all your Ideals, your Nova Power Words are **Unlocked** 
until the end of the current Storyline.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt or Combo for 
free; if you spend 1 Might, you can include the second Nova Power Word 
as well.
