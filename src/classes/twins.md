## Skills

You have the **Explorer** skill, plus two additional skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses one of your skills, add 1 extra die. If
you have more than one skill that could apply to a roll, add 1 extra die for each
applicable skill.

## Power Words

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until it is off cooldown.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Does** **Whatever** and **Can**.
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt 
or Combo, 2 Might to add two, and 3 Might to add all three.

1 Might, you can include the second Nova Power Word as well.
