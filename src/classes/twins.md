## Playing the Twins

You have Skills, Abilities, and possibly other Power Words that 
you can use to switch up your moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.

## Questions

As you create your Twin heroes, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::
- How do you look different from normal humans? 
  - How much larger (or smaller) are you than other people? 
  - What color is your skin, and what does it feel and look like? 
  - What kind of strange appearance do you have that makes the ignorant 
    assume you're just an animalistic brute?
  - What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do 
    you employ?
- Are you *always* a kid?  
  (If not, then you may want to consider playing your hero as 
   <a href="#toc-multi-class">Multi-Class Hero</a> -- this is appropriate
   for heroes who magically transform from child form to an adult shape!)
  - If not, what triggers that change? 
    Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, a magic word,
    or your own free will? 
  - How do you get along with adult heroes? Do you look up to them as
    role models? Do they usually talk down to you?
  - In what ways are you less mature than the average hero?
  - In what ways are you more mature than the average hero?
  - Were you *always* a hero? How did you become one? Why did you
    become one?
  - Do you have any other friends your age, or do you just associate with
    adult heroes?
- What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people? 
  - Are you an artist at heart, a scientist, a poet, a doctor, a pilot? 
  - What would push you over that edge, and how have you avoided going 
    over it so far?

## Skills

You have the **Explorer** skill, plus two additional skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses one of your skills, add 1 extra die. If
you have more than one skill that could apply to a roll, add 1 extra die for each
applicable skill.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until it is off cooldown.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Does** **Whatever** and **Can**.
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt 
or Combo, 2 Might to add two, and 3 Might to add all three.

When you use a **Power Display,** you can add one Personal Power Word for free.

You can use two Power Personal Words together to form a **Power Stunt** 
or **Power Combo** by paying 1 Might for each beyond the first.

### Nova Power

Choose at least two but no more than four single words you like; 
these are your **Nova Power Words**, and together are known as your
**Nova Power Phrase**.

When you check off all your Ideals, your Nova Power Words are 
**Unlocked** until the end of the current Storyline.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt or Combo for free; if you spend
1 Might, you can include the second Nova Power Word as well.
