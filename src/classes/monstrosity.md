# The Monstrosity {#toc-monstrosity .breakbefore .class}

> So here's how this is gonna go. I'm gonna punch ya, you're gonna get real hurt, then give up. Capeesh?

A monster.

That's what they say you are.

Because of your strength, your size, your appearance.

You're more than that -- you always have been -- but most people
won't look beyond the obvious and see you as you truly are.

Well, then. If they want a monster *that badly*, maybe you should
be the monster they say you are?

## Playing a Monstrosity

Your hero is really, really good at breaking things. You're going
to want to advance the Smash goal whenever you can, but keep in
mind that you're more than *just* muscle. You have Skills, Abilities,
and possibly other Power Words that you can use switch up your
moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.

## Questions

As you create your Monstrosity hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::
- How do you look different from normal humans? 
  - How much larger are you than other people? 
  - What color is your skin, and what does it feel like? 
  - What kind of strange appearance do you have that
    makes the ignorant assume you're a mere brute? 
  - What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do you employ?
- Are you *always* a monster? 
  - If not, what triggers that change? 
  - Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, or your own
    choice? 
  - Will people not like you when you're angry?
  - *Were* you always a monster?
- What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people? 
  - Are you an artist at heart, a scientist, a poet, a doctor, a pilot? 
- Why *aren't* you the monster they say you are? 
  - What makes you a *hero* and not a villain or mindless threat? 
  - What would push you over that edge, and how have you avoided going 
    over it so far?
