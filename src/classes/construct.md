# The Construct {#toc-construct .breakbefore .class}

> I must not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
  being to come to harm.
  I must obey orders given to me by human beings, except where such orders
  would conflict with the previous law.
  I must protect my own existence as long as such protection does not 
  conflict with the previous two laws.

"Just a machine."

That's all they say you are. Created in a lab, created by other
people, originally from non-living material.

Who *doesn't* that describe? Spoiler: humans are all created by other
humans.

Do **your** origins make **you** any *less* of a person than I am?

You're more than just a simple gadget or toy. You've found there
is more to being a person than simply being born human or looking
like they do.

## Playing a Construct

[]{.lorem}

## Questions

As you create your Construct hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::
- How do you look different from normal humans? 
  - How much larger are you than other people? 
  - What color is your skin, and what does it feel like? 
  - What kind of strange appearance do you have that
    makes the ignorant assume you're a mere brute? 
  - What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do you employ?
- Are you *always* a monster?  
  (If not, then you may want to consider playing your hero as 
   <a href="#toc-multi-class">a Multi-Class Hero</a>.)
  - If not, what triggers that change? 
  - Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, or your own free will? 
  - Will people not like you when you're angry? Why not?
  - *Were* you always a monster?
- What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people? 
  - Are you an artist at heart, a scientist, a poet, a doctor, a pilot? 
- Why *aren't* you the monster they say you are? 
  - What makes you a *hero* and not a villain or mindless threat? 
  - What would push you over that edge, and how have you avoided going 
    over it so far?

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until it is off cooldown.
