in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, 
and adds another 1 Success to the Effectiveness of a roll.

By spending yet 1 *more* Might point you can add your *other* 
Core Power Word as a *fourth* Power Word in a Power Stunt. 
Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 Successes on the rolls
Effectiveness, but also costs you 3 Might points.
