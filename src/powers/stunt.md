## Power Displays {#toc-power-displays}

When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word
and explain how you're using that power.

A Power Display doesn't cost any Might points.

Power Displays don't have a game-mechanics effect on your rolls, but you
can use them to explain how you're able to *make* those rolls. 

For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it
as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to 
the skies to throw a punch. 

If you don't have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your
Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby 
skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.

## Power Stunts {#toc-power-stunts .colbefore}

A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together, and unlike
a Power Display, a Stunt will affect the result of your next roll.
In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.

When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words
and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you're
hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe
what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory
effects.

After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an
appropriate roll for your Power Stunt -- either to increase the
Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an
additional 1 Success to the Effectiveness of the roll based on your Stunt.

You don't have to come up with Power Stunts beforehand; instead,
you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your
creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.

For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you
could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase
"Flight Speed". Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt
means that when you make a roll -- such as rolling your Adventure
Facet to Outwit a foe -- increases your roll's Effectiveness by
1 Success, even if you rolled 0 Successes.

## Power Combos {#toc-power-combos .colbefore}

A **Power Combo** is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work
together, with their powers combined. 

To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they'd
like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you're trying
to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are
taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.

You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long
as you can come up with an explanation of how they're helping.

The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, 
and they're called the initiating hero for that Combo.

A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt -- the player of the
initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them,
spending 1 point of Might and increasing the Effectiveness
of the next roll by 1 Success.

The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another
Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which increases the roll's
Effectiveness by 1 Success.

Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one 
of their Core Power Words as a *third* (or fourth) Power Word in 
the Combo.

For example, []{.lorem}

## Using Personal Power Words {#toc-power-use-personal .colbefore}

[]{.lorem}

## Using Core Power Words {#toc-power-use-core .colbefore}

You can use one of your Core Power Words as a *third* Power Word 
in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, 
and adds another 1 Success to the Effectiveness of a roll.

By spending yet 1 *more* Might point you can add your *other* 
Core Power Word as a *fourth* Power Word in a Power Stunt. 
Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 Successes on the rolls
Effectiveness, but also costs you 3 Might points.

For example,  []{.lorem}

## Using Nova Power Words {#toc-power-use-nova .colbefore}

Once you've completed your hero's Motivations track, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Story Arc.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words as the *second* Power
Word in a Stunt without spending any Might; likewise, you can add 
use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the 
Nova Power Word still increases the roll's Effectiveness by 1 Success.

Using your *other* Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or
Power Combo requires spending 1 Might. 

For example, []{.lorem}

## Scene Power Words {#toc-power-use-scene}

Each scene has up to 6 Scene Power Words, chosen by the Editor.

You can use one Scene Power Word as a second Power Word in a 
Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, 
but they still contribute 1 Success to the Effectiveness of a roll.

Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, 
and it likewise increases the Effectiveness of that Combo.

For example, []{.lorem}
