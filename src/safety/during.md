# During the Game

When you get caught up in playing []{.gamename}, it can sometimes
be hard to gauge how everyone else is feeling. These tools can be
used while you're playing to make it easier to share.

## Breaks

For Issues that run longer than 2 hours or Issues that have 
intense content, having a short built-in break is recommended 
to allow people to stay focused and process. Allow for 
discussion, bio breaks, or any other needs during this time.

As a general rule, the Editor should offer a break after a Crisis 
concludes. The players might not want one, in which case the
game continues.

## Open Door

The **Open Door** is the assurance that someone can leave or take 
a break from the game for their own safety and well-being without 
being judged.  State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

## Comic Page Change Tools {#toc-script-change}

During play, you can use **Comic Script Change Tools** to adjust 
play and content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards with the words written on them, typing the first letter of the 
move in the chat function of the video conference software or 
virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand signals. 

Before each Issue of []{.gamename}, Editors and players should
discuss how to use each of these tools.

**Retcon** can be used when something has happened in play 
that makes a participant uncomfortable.  When **Retcon** is 
used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to retcon...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a point before 
it happened, and play starts again.

**Later That Day, ...** can be used when a participant would like to 
skip past uncomfortable content or to the next part of the 
story for pacing.  When **Later** is used by tapping the card, 
typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud 
("I’d like to go to later that day..."), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

**Meanwhile, ...** can be used when everyone is ready to continue play, 
often after adjusting or discussing content. When **Meanwhile** 
used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or 
stating it out loud ("Meanwhile...?"), continue with play if 
everyone agrees they're ready.

**Continued Next Page** can be used when things are too intense, 
but you still want to continue playing the scene. When **Continued**
is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or 
stating it out loud ("I’d like to continue to the next page..."), 
you can take a break and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
**Continued**, you can use **Meanwhile**, **Retcon**, or **Later**.
