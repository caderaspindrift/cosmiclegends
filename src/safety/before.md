# Before the Game

Before you even start playing an Issue of []{.gamename}, talk about 
what you want to see in the game -- and what you don't want to see.

If you're planning a long, open-ended Series, you may even want to 
devoted a whole session to this -- called an *Issue 0* in []{.gamename};
for shorter games you should at least touch on these topics.

## Lines and Veils

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on content, things that the Editor or the 
players don’t want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means that the content might 
be in the game but not spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

## Using the Comics Code {#toc-comics-code}

Don't worry, I promise the CCA isn't going to shut down your game. 

Despite how terrible 
the [Comics Code](http://cbldf.org/the-comics-code-of-1954/) was in 
reality -- and it had a *stifling* effect on freedom of expression 
in comics for decades -- it *does* give an interesting snapshot of 
the types of content that might show up in a Bronze Age superhero game.

The following questions are inspired by items in the Comics Code and
are intended to start conversations -- not end them! (Remember that when
we say [*heroes*](#toc-glossary) in Cosmic Legends, we're talking about 
what other games would call *player characters* -- not necessarily
about *non-player characters (NPCs) who happen to be heroic/good guys*.)

As you discuss these questions as a group, anyone should feel free to 
request a line or veil on these or any other subjects.

# [The Comics Code]{#soapbox-comics-code}

Are we saying we approve of the CCA and what it tried to do? No! 
"Self-censorship imposed to avoid government censorship" is wrong 
and we're not suggesting that the Comics Code had a beneficial effect 
on the comics of the time.

Instead, we urge you to think **not** in terms of *following the Comics Code*
but instead of *how your Series is going to deliberately break it*.
To us, that's the best way to repurpose and subvert this McCarthyistic
relic that lasted into the 21st Century at the major comics publishers.
