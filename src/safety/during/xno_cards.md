# X, N, and O Cards

**X**, **N**, and **O cards** are check-in tools. They can be
used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in
the chat function of the video conference software
or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand
signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone
that they are available and how to use them.

The **X card** can be used at any point if a
participant is uncomfortable with the content
happening in-game. When the **X card** is used by
tapping the card or typing an **“X”** in the chat, the
group can change, rewind, or skip the content.

The **N card** can be used at any point if a participant
feels like they are headed towards an X. When the
**N card** is used by tapping the card or typing an
**“N”** in the chat, the group can change the content
or have the scene “fade to black.”

The **O card** can be used at any point if a
participant wants to continue with the content.
When the **O card** is used by tapping the card
or typing an **“O”** in the chat, the group is ok to
continue with the content. They can also regularly
be prompted by a **“O?”** asked out loud or in the
chat to check-in if everyone is still ok.
