# Breaks

For Issues that run longer than 2 hours or Issues that have 
intense content, having a short built-in break is recommended 
to allow people to stay focused and process. Allow for 
discussion, bio breaks, or any other needs during this time.

As a general rule, the Editor should offer a break after a Crisis concludes.
