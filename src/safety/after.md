# After the Game  {#toc-safety-after}

When you finish an Issue of []{.gamename}, it's important to look
back at the things you enjoyed the most and the things you didn't 
like as much.

## Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over into post-game 
life. This can affect the enjoyment of the game, as well as 
out-of-game relationships between players and Editor if not 
worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game begins and ends, and being 
conscious of which feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

## Stars and Wishes {#toc-stars-wishes}

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the session and communicate 
feedback in a positive and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed and loved 
about the game. This could include a particular moment of roleplay, 
a Crisis created by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular interactions 
between heroes, potential story moments and development, or 
anything else that could make the game even better in the future.
