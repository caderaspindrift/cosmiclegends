# Issue 0

**Issue 0** -- known as a *Session 0* in other games -- is an
Issue of a []{.gamename} Series when the players don't roll dice and 
handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person
is looking forward to playing.

An Issue 0 should go over the safety tools used in the game, stress
the importance of open communication, and set expectations on the kind
of story and play.

Issue 0s are also a great time to make heroes together, rather than 
individually.

One-Shots obviously won't have a separate Issue 0, but time should still
be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on these important aspects
of []{.gamename}.
