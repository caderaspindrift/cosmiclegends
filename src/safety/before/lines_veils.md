# Lines and Veils

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries
on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on
content, things that the Editor or the players don’t
want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are
soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means
that the content might be in the game but not
spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the
game.
