# Script Change Rating

**Script Change** ratings are used to set tone and
boundaries for your game. Using film ratings (or
your own), you can outline what audience you’re
playing for (e.g. PG-13 vs R). 

The **rating** also
addresses what content players do want to see
as well as what they don’t want to see. Make sure
to balance and respect everyone’s do and don’t
wants. 

**Ratings** and do-and-don’t-want content can
be adjusted as needed throughout the game.
