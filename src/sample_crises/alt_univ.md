# Alternate Universes {#toc-sample-alternate-universes}

Alt Universe crises take familiar characters and twist them into unregognizable personalities andmotivations. In this way they're quite similar to a supervillain team or a rival superhero team -- described later in the Crises section.

In some situations, the main heroes end up in an alternate universe, and the inhabitants of that universe are people they already know from their original universe -- and their primary goal may be to return home even if they don't set everything "right" in the alt-universe.

Related vignettes include heroes who find alternate versions of people they care about, and how they choose to relate to those variants. Some alt-universes are parallel timelines, and heroes may end up waxing nostalgic about what could have been, and debating whether they feel responsible for these worlds
that are very similar to "home".

Because of these similarities in personalities ad histories, the heroes may be at a distinct advantage over any variants they encounter. If a variant is an alternate-timeline version of one of their loved ones, they could know more about that variant than the alt-universe natives know of the heroes' lives in their own universe. 

"Aha, so you became a Knight when your parents were murderered by a random street criminal, while I became a Knight when my children were murdered by a random street criminal." "As our own Titan is vulnerable to saline water, I hypothesize that yours might have a similar weaknesss, being a Sentinel from an analogue of our Saturn."
