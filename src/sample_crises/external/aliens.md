::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: moves ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Crowds in Danger (2)
:   The aliens fire blasts at the roof of the mall, causing
    debris to fall below. All goals except Rescue increase by
    2 until you advance the Rescue goal.

Impenetrable Force Field (4)
:   A nearly invisible bubble of solid force surrounds the
    aliens' saucers; the heroes can't advance the Smash goal
    next Hero Phase.

Maser Cannons (2)
:   An alien gunner fires their ship's cannons at the heroes.
    One hero takes 3 damage.

Sonic Probe Waves (2)
:   Choosing one of the heroes, the aliens fire sonic waves
    to measure their powers and abilities. That hero can't
    use the Suspense approach for the rest of the Crisis,
    and takes 1 extra damage if shot with the masers for each
    time they've been probed.

Tractor Beam (3)
:   One of the heroes is caught in the aliens' tractor beam
    and is unable to move. Advance the Smash or Outwit goal
    to free the hero.

Tranq Gas (4)
:   Fearing attacks from the heroes, the aliens release a
    foul-smelling tranquilizer gas. All heroes lose 2
    Might as the gas saps their strength.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: resolve ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Smash
:   With their saucer fleet in disarray, the aliens are
    easily disarmed and taken into custody.

Outwit
:   Having determined that they won't be able to find
    what they are looking for on Earth, the aliens abandon
    any captured bystanders and make haste for the edge of
    the atmosphere.

Allay
:   As the heroes speak with the aliens, the invaders 
    stand down, explaining the reason for their
    journey to the planet Earth.

Rescue
:   With the mall completely evacuated, the aliens' kidnapping
    mission has failed, and they beat a hasty retreat.

Defeat
:   If the heroes can't stop the aliens, they will kidnap
    12 innocent bystanders, minus 2 for every time the
    heroes advanced a goal. As a followup, the heroes can
    track the aliens to their mothership.
