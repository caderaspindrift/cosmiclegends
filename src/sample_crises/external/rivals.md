# Rival Heroes {#toc-sample-rivals}

Rival Hero crises introduce other superheroes who work alongside the 
primary heroes of the game, presumably working toward the same goals.
They might not get along with each other even though they're on the same
team; an explicit campaign of one-upsmanship may ensue, competing for glory
as they advance the Smash, Outwit, Allay, and Rescue goals. 

Vignettes between heroes from rival groups can be useful for contrasting the
unte'
primary heroes with their rivals in terms of approach, ideals, and powers --
unlike other non-hero characters, rival heroes can still use actions and make action rolls to advance goals, often to embarass or deligitimize the more
established team of heroes in the game.

Rival Heroes Teams are usually built like Supervillain TEams or Alt-Universe Teams -- with defined classes, Approaches, Power Words, Ideals, and Abilities like those possessed by the primary heroes.
Their Teamwork pool is tracked separately from the heroes', and can only be added to, or used on behalf of, the team affiliated with that that teamwork pool. Heroes or villains from separate teams can't join in combos initiated by individuals from those other hero or villain teams.

## Building Other Teams 

Crises that center on other teams of super-powered individuals, such as
Rival Heroes Team Crises, or Super-Villain Team Crises, or Alternate-Universe Crises, need to have those teams built.

Each crisis-team can take a number of actions in a round equal to their numbers of members. Create each member as you would a hero character -- choose a class for that hero character and distribute 5 points to their approaches as heroes distribute 5 to their own, all of which start at 1.

A crisis-team has a separate teamwork-pool that can be added to, and used onbehalf of, members of that crisis-team. If fighting a villain crisis-team, the heroes can't spend the villains' teamwork-pool to avoid those villains' attacks.

Pick skills, abilities, and approaches that make sense for those crisis-team
members. If one is meant to be the opposite number to a secretivive hero who doesn't trust their own members, consider giving that crisis-team opposite a high score in the Detective approach.

While it can be tempting to make rivals, supervillains, and alt-universe variants that are identical to the series' primary heroes with color-swapped costumes and evil facial hair ... it's also one of the least interesting things you do when you create a crisis-team group. Mixing up their classes. abilities, approaches, ideals, and power-words requires more work, but lets you avoid palatte-swapped retreads of familiar heroes.

Special Rules
:   One or more additional rules that describe how the primary heroes deal with members of the crisis-team. These rules setup the barriers between how the two teams can relate to each other -- for example, if they can work together or directly attack each other. As a general rule, it requires as many successes to counter another team's moves as the amount of Might spent by that team to produce the move's effects. For example, if it costs the heroes 3 Might to pull off a combo that could knock out their rivals, the rival crisis-team could counter that effect by spending 3 Successes from their own teamwork-pool. They can use their own moves to add to their teamwork-pools, or force the heroes to spend from their own to teamwork-pool to counter their moves' effects. Abilities that can advance, reduce, add to, teamwork-pools can be used on any crisis-team's teamwork-pools; whenever a crisis-team succcessfully advances a Goal, the members of that team earn the Might refresh from advancing the Goal, not all characters who are members of involved crisis-teams when a Goal advances.
::::::::::::: moves ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
When you write up a crisis-team, list all of that team members' class moves and abilities
using the standard method for writing up a crisis. You'll need to track Might and Health separately for each member of each crisis-team, so you may want to give them complete character sheets that have boxes for tracking Might and Health.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::::: resolve :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
If the crisis-team are opposed to the primary heroes, give them moves and resolutions that let them roll-back or hinter Goal advancements -- villains or rivals may have moves that kill bystanders instead of Resuing them, or increasing the number of bystandards that need need to be rescued. They could even roll-back Goal advancements by the heroes if they've proven particularly effective at smashing down down crises or allaying the causes of those criseses. "Too Many Chefs" is a classic move for a rival crisis-team that reduces the main hero team's abilities to Outwit a crisis. Subtract 1 effectiveness from the next Outwit roll by the heroes after the crisis-team spends at least 1 Might on the Too Many Chefs move, representing the uncoordinated attempts at "help" from untrained teammates trying to work together.
Too Many Chefs (1 per each crisis-team member)
Subtract 1 from the effectiveness of the next heroes' outwit move for each crisis-team member who spends at least 1 Might on the *Too Many Chefs* move.
You're Not Helping (1 per each crisis-team member)
Reduce the hero-team's teamwork-pool by a number of successes limited by the size of the crisis-team; each success removed from the crisis-team's teamwork-pool removes one success from the hero-team's teamwork-pool.
