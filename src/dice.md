# Rolling Dice {#toc-dice .breakbefore}

The dice mechanic in []{.gamename} is a pool of six-sided dice. 
When a player wants to take an uncertain action, they build a dice pool.

- One die for every point they have in the relevant Facet
- One die for every Volume if they have a relevant Skill
- Two dice if they can mark off a relevant part of their Motivation
- One die for every Power Word beyond the first

Any dice that come up a 5 or a 6 are counted as Successes. 
A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).

Any dice that come up 2, 3, or 4 are ignored.

Any dice that come up 1 are counted as Edge Successes. 
When a player rolls a 1, they inform the Editor, 
who offers them a consequence. 

If the player chooses to take the Editorâ€™s consequence, 
they count the 1 as a Success.

This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be 
narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. 
The important part is that the player is presented with a difficult choice.
