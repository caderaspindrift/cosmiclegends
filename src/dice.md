# Using the Dice {#toc-dice .colbefore}

The dice mechanic in []{.gamename} is a **dice pool** of six-sided dice. 
When a player wants to take an uncertain action, they build a dice pool.

- One die for every point they have in the relevant Approach
- One die for every Volume if they have a relevant Skill
- Two dice if they can mark off one of their Ideals
- One die for every Power Word they're using in a Power Display, Power Stunt, or Power Combo
- Other dice from any other source

 Die Roll   Result
----------  ---------------------
    6       +1 Success
    5       +1 Success
    4       --
    3       --
    2       --
    1       Edge Success

Any dice that come up a 5 or a 6 are counted as Successes. 
A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).

Any dice that come up 2, 3, or 4 are ignored.

Any dice that come up 1 are counted as Edge Successes. 
When a player rolls a 1, they inform the Editor, 
who offers them a consequence. 

If the player chooses to take the Editorâ€™s consequence, 
they count the 1 as a Success.

This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be 
narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. 
The important part is that the player is presented with a difficult choice.
