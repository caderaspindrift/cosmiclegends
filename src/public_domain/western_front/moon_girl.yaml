- history: |
    "Raised in a small kingdom in a remote part of Samarkand, the girl known as the 
    Princess of the Moon was taught that she came from a long line of women who had 
    been unbeatable in battle. Unfortunately, she wasn't told this until after she had 
    sworn to herself that she would never marry a man unless he was a superior warrior 
    to her.

    Taking her family heirloom, a moonstone said to make the wearer invincible, she left 
    her home and traveled to America in search of Prince Mengu, a suitor she had liked 
    but easily defeated. Finding him working as a teacher under an assumed name, she 
    created her own false identity, Clare Lune, and found work at the same school. 
    She then convinced Prince Mengu to join her in fighting crime.

    Later, she was joined by a female sidekick called Starlet.

    Moon Girl fought enemies such as Satana, Mabelene, Invaders from Venus, Lurani, and Undina."
