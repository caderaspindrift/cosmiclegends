    "Bruce Carter I was a soldier in the Revolutionary War. Given a 
    special mission by General George Washington, Carter was killed 
    by British spies, and the information he was carrying fell into 
    enemy hands. His spirit was confined to Earth for his failure.

    Bruce Carter III was the spitting image of his great-grandfather. 
    He was visited by the ghost of Bruce Carter I, who showed him the 
    location of a magical cloak and tri-corner hat that would give the 
    wearer invulnerability and super strength.

    Only Carter III's girlfriend, Joan Farwell, knew of his dual identity."
- powers: |
    "In addition to his superhuman strength and invulnerability, Fighting 
    Yank was frequently aided by his grandfather's ghost, especially 
    when he was in mortal danger. The ghost could manipulate the physical 
    world and provide Bruce III with information and encouragement."
