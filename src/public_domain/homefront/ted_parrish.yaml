    "Ted Parrish was a famous Hollywood film star who found himself 
    typecast as a romantic lead. Frustrated with the situation, 
    Parrish told his producer that he would walk away from his contract 
    if he didn't get a \"he-man\" role. 
    
    On the way home, he saw a young woman getting kidnapped by a pair 
    of mad scientists. He used his mastery of disguise to track them down 
    and rescue the girl.

    The experience made him realize fighting actual crime was far more 
    exciting than playing an action hero, he decided to keep adventuring 
    under the alias of Man of a 1000 Faces. Because few people saw him 
    without some disguise or another, most didn't realize that Parrish 
    and the Man of a 1000 Faces were one and the same.

    In October 1942, Ted Parrish teamed up with Captain Freedom, Black Cat, 
    War Nurse, and Shock Gibson to repel the Japanese attempt to invade 
    Los Angeles."
