- history: |
    "Linda Turner, daughter of a movie star and a stunt woman, became 
    one of Hollywood's biggest stars who got bored with the make-believe 
    life of Hollywood. 
    
    When she came across a plot by Nazi spy and director Garboil she 
    realized she could help her country and have fun by taking on the 
    identity of the Black Cat. 
    
    She was assisted by Rick Horne, a reporter for the Los Angeles 
    Daily Globe, and her sidekick Black Kitten.

    In October 1942, the Black Cat teamed up with Shock Gibson, Captain 
    Freedom, Ted Parrish, War Nurse and the Girl Commandos to repel the 
    Japanese invasion of Hollywood. She also teamed up with Gibson and 
    Captain Freedom in later adventures.

    In January 1942, Black Cat teamed up with Spirit of '76 and Agent 99 
    in two separate adventures. Black Cat ran into Agent 99 while he was 
    in Los Angeles rounding up Gestapo agents at the request of the FBI. 
    Black Cat, Rick Horne and Agent 99 worked together to bring the Gestapo 
    agents to justice. 
    
    Before the adventurers parted ways, Black Cat gave Agent 99 a kiss. 
    Noticing Rick's jealous reactions, the British agent said that much 
    as he would love to stay with the beautiful heroine, his work would 
    always have to come first.

    Among her more notable enemies are Fire Bug, The Sceptre, Cleopatra, 
    and the Crimson Raider."
