- history: |
    "A taxi driver was hypnotized by a swami who enjoyed building race 
    cars. The swami's best race car, the Silver Streak, seemed to be 
    targeted by someone or something, for every time someone drove it, 
    they were attacked and killed by a giant insect. 
    
    The taxi driver was attacked and killed, but the swami brought him 
    back to life and put him behind the wheel of the Silver Streak to 
    find the bad guy. 
    
    He battled the likes of the Green Dragon and many other foes during 
    his superhero career.  He was based in New York City."
- powers: |
    "He became a costumed hero with a \"secret fluid\" 
    in his blood which allowed him to defy gravity. One peculiar trait - 
    Silver Streak's powers can be transferred to others through blood 
    transfusions. That is how both his sidekick(s), Mercury/Meteor, 
    and his pet falcon, Whiz, received their powers."
- weapons: |
    "Silver Streak wore special \"suction shoes\", which allowed him to 
    reach greater speeds as well as the ability to run up walls."
