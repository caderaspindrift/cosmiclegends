- history: |
    Johnny Dynamite was a hard-boiled private detective, known 
    as \"The Wild Man from Chicago.\" He was a tough guy with 
    contacts on both sides of the law. He was good friends 
    with a DA, but was readily accepted by denizens of the 
    underworld. His office was on State Street in a big city 
    (probably New York). 
    
    Johnny was shot in the right eye by Myra Benz, who tried 
    to knock him off with a gun disguised as a camera. After 
    losing the eye, Johnny wore a patch. He smoked cigarettes 
    constantly, cursed frequently, and had a bad habit of 
    getting shot and beaten by his enemies. 
    
    But, he gave as good as he got. He was an experienced and 
    persistent detective and often carried a concealed handgun 
    (his guns included a palm pistol, .45 and a colt revolver, 
    possibly others), though in later cases, he mostly relied 
    on his fists. 
    
    He seemed to take his cases very personally, 
    and killed many of his early foes, claiming they were 
    reaching for a weapon. Some, such as Myra Benz, he brazenly 
    killed without any true justification beyond his own sense 
    of justice.

    Johnny often worked with police homicide detective Luke 
    Hennessy. Johnny's sister lived in Maine, and her daughter, 
    Marcella Rush, was an aspiring actress who got hooked on 
    heroin when she came to New York and shot a man who tried 
    to rape her. 
    
    Johnny had a number of girlfriends at different times, 
    including Judy Kane, but most were killed or turned out 
    be killers.
