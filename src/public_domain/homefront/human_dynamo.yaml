- history: |
    "Charles Gibson, a wealthy scientist, was experimenting with 
    electricity and chemicals when lightning struck his lab. The 
    electrical shock caused the lab to explode, but Gibson emerged 
    from the wreckage with a body that could conduct and generate 
    electricity. 
    
    His friend and fellow scientist, Dr. Blitzen, pointed out that 
    this power gave him an opportunity to change the world for the 
    better. Swearing to use his powers for the good of humanity, he 
    decided to fight crime as Shock Gibson, the Human Dynamo. In 
    spite of using his surname in his code-name, nobody can figure 
    out who he is under the mask.

    For the first half of his crime-fighting career, Shock Gibson 
    embraced the useless weakling playboy cliche in civilian life to 
    allay suspicion. When World War II escalated, he enlisted in 
    the Army, donning his costume when necessary. At first, he tried 
    to maintain the pretense of being weak and useless, but the 
    realities of army life forced him to abandon it.

    Shock Gibson teamed up with Captain Freedom, Black Cat, War Nurse, 
    and Ted Parrish to repel the Japanese attempt to invade Los Angeles."

    "He can generate enough electricity to shock an entire river, 
    weld metal, and even blast through metal walls. He also can fly, 
    has super-strength, and can generate electromagnetism. Early on, 
    he needed to recharge periodically, but that became less and less 
    necessary with continued practice."
