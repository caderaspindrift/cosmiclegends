- history: |
    As a child, Bart Hill was witness to his parents' brutal murder. 
    The murderer also branded Bart with a hot iron, leaving a 
    boomerang-shaped scar on the left side of his chest. 
    
    This traumatic experience left the boy mute. He trained his entire 
    life in the art of the boomerang, eventually becoming a master 
    boomerang marksman. He then donned a costume and took to the 
    streets as the vigilante crime-fighter known as Daredevil.

    However... he is actually able to speak and it was later learned 
    that his parents were killed while in Australia with Bart then raised 
    by a tribe of aborigines who taught him the art of using boomerangs. 
    As an adult, he returned to the U.S. and fought crime as Daredevil.
