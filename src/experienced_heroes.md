# [Creating Experienced Heroes]{#toc-experienced-heroes}

In general, heroes in []{.gamename} are created at Volume 1. But
sometimes you might need to create a more advanced hero. Why?

- You're replacing a retired (or dead) hero and the Series is
  Volume 2 or higher.
- You're joining an ongoing Series of Volume 2 or higher.
- You're playing in a [Special Issue or One-Shot](#toc-struct-one-shots) 
  of Volume 2 or higher.
- You're playing as a [Guest Star](#toc-struct-crossover) in an
  ongoing Series of Volume 2 or higher.
- Your group decided to start the Series at Volume 2 or higher.

As described in the section on [Advancements](#toc-advancements), 
you get to choose one Advancement at the conclusion of each
Storyline. However, each hero in a series gets one 
[Storyline](#toc-issues) where they're the Spotlight Hero, every
Volume.

So the number of Advancements earned by a hero depends on how many
heroes are in the Series! This is demonstrated in the following table.

An average number of heroes is four (4); if you're making an experienced

like, and those you can choose only once per Volume. In the following rules,
