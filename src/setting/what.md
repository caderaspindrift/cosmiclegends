:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats (A.L.E.R.T.)
was created by the U.S. Congress sometime after World War II and before Titan's
arrival on Earth in October of 1956 -- as they were well-equipped to handle
the Saturnian Sentinel, had it proven necessary.

A.L.E.R.T. usually works with the Cosmic Legends, although the two groups have 
clashed in the past -- most notably when A.L.E.R.T. was infiltrated by agents 
of T.R.E.L.A.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
**History:**
As a child, Sienna MacGowan heard legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann 
from her grandmother, and she claimed the Celtic gods even spoke 
to her in her dreams.

When she grew older, Sienna's dreams faded and she no longer
believed in the mythological aspects of Celtic fables. Instead,
she resolved to prove that the Tuatha Dé Danann were historical
beings as mortal as anyone else. 

Armed with an archaeology degree, Sienna was working late at a 
digsite outside the village of Skryne, when a voice called out to
her, asking why she had forgotten her dreams. The experience
repeated each night, although none save her heard the voice.

Finding no logical explanation for the phenomenon, Sienna replied
to the voice and asked who was speaking. The goddess Brigit appeared
before Sienna, told her she was the Champion of the 
Tuatha Dé Danann, and gifted her with power.

**Powers:**
When Sienna speaks the magic words, *Claidheamh Soluis*, she is
transformed into the superhumanly powerful Champion, Brigantia.
Her powers include flight, wisdom, super-speed, super-strength, 
and projection of light rays from her eyes; in times of great 
need, she can form a sword of blazing light.

# Saturn {#setting-saturn}

::::::::::: place :::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- **Population:** unknown
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The people of Saturn's moon Titan are not native to the
Solar System; according to their oldest tales, they were
taken from their home planet by a civilization known as
the Visitors, were subjected to scientific experiments, 
and were eventually abandoned on Titan.

Titanians -- known as *Ro'Tan'Okk* in their own language --
have strong mental powers and communicate by telepathy as
often as they use *Ro'Tan'Kesh*. 

They are physically superior to humans, with most able to 
lift over 50 tons with minimal effort. Their only weakness 
is a strong reaction to being touched by salt water, which 
burns them and drains their energy.

There are four known genders among the Titanians; Earthlings
are only familiar with the *nyrr-t'vor* gender thanks to
the presence of Ty'Tonn To'Rezz on Earth. Titanian families
are comprised of 3 or more spouses and their children.

The *Ro'Tan'Okk* have no concepts of war or crime; the
closest thing to a military in Titanian society is the
*Kyl'Sh'Tal* -- the famed Sentinels of Saturn. Sentinels
are astronomers tasked with constant vigilance -- to watch
the skies for the return of the Visitors.

The people of Vulcanor are an offshoot of humanity that was
experimented on by the Visitors over 3,000 years ago; their
skin was hardened to a shiny gloss and they were adapted to
live in volcanic conditions. Slaying their Visitor enslavers
and stealing a shuttle craft, they settled on an otherwise
uninhabitable remote chain of islands in the south Pacific.

That distance allowed the Vulcanors time to disassemble and
reverse-engineer many Visitor technologies, including a
compass-scrambling magnetic field that cloaked their islands
from the European colonialist powers.

With the arrival of Titan on Earth in 1956, King Tachylus 
decreed it was time to join the rest of the world and share --
in limited amounts -- their unique technologies. His son
Obsidius was sent as an emissary and later joined the
Cosmic Legends of the Universe.

Excessive heat and volcanic gasses prevent the Vulcanor 
Islands from becoming a vacation destination. While outsiders
are welcomed and treated with respect, few non-Vulcanors have 
been Volcano City.
