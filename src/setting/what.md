The Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats (A.L.E.R.T.)
was created by the U.S. Congress sometime after World War II and before Titan's
arrival on Earth in October of 1956 -- as they were well-equipped to handle
the Saturnian Sentinel, had it proven necessary.

A.L.E.R.T. usually works with the Cosmic Legends, although the two groups have 
clashed in the past -- most notably when A.L.E.R.T. was infiltrated by agents 
of T.R.E.L.A.

**History:**
As a child, Sienna MacGowan heard legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann 
from her grandmother, and she claimed the Celtic gods even spoke 
to her in her dreams.

When she grew older, Sienna's dreams faded and she no longer
believed in the mythological aspects of Celtic fables. Instead,
she resolved to prove that the Tuatha Dé Danann were historical
beings as mortal as anyone else. 

Armed with an archaeology degree, Sienna was working late at a 
digsite outside the village of Skryne, when a voice called out to
her, asking why she had forgotten her dreams. The experience
repeated each night, although none save her heard the voice.

Finding no logical explanation for the phenomenon, Sienna replied
to the voice and asked who was speaking. The goddess Brigit appeared
before Sienna, told her she was the Champion of the 
Tuatha Dé Danann, and gifted her with power.

**Powers:**
When Sienna speaks the magic words, *Claidheamh Soluis*, she is
transformed into the superhumanly powerful Champion, Brigantia.
Her powers include flight, wisdom, super-speed, super-strength, 
and projection of light rays from her eyes; in times of great 
need, she can form a sword of blazing light.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
**History:**
Del Thompson grew up in the shadow of brilliance -- his mother and namesake,
Delphine Thompson, was one of the most gifted physicists of her generation.

Unfortunately, her genius led her to take dangerous risks, including going
online with an experimental cold fusion reactor before all the appropriate
safeties were online. "You only need those when things go wrong," Delphine
explained to her son, then ten years old. "And I never get things wrong."

As fate would have it ... that was the time that Thompson's hubris was proven
a false vanity. The reactor raged out of control as dangerous energies washed
over her laboratory and the rest of Technopolis.

With Delphine unconscious and dying from radiation poisoning, only quick 
thinking by Del managed to halt the out-of-control reaction -- at the cost
of his life. The young boy was completely disintegrated.

Or so everyone believed. Over the next few weeks, Del reformed his body
from pure nuclear energy. He regained consciousness to find his
mother had survived -- but had likewise been changed by the overloaded
reactor. Calling herself Neutrino, she fled police custody and soon joined
the newly-forming Villains, Inc.

Del was taken in by his mother's former lab partner, Hazel Montgomery,
the original Vespa. Together with Montgomery's child Lin -- the sidekick
hero Bug -- Del became one of the first two students at Technopolis Academy 
and a founding member of the Junior Legends of America.

**Powers:**
Del's natural state of being is a humanoid form composed of supercharged plasma.
He can use this energy as destructive blasts, as an energy-backed "nuke punch!", 
and as a force bubble to absorb energy.

With concentration -- and as a result of years of practice -- he can dampen
his nuclear energies and assume a human shape, becoming the young man he would
have been had his mother's pride not cost them both dearly.

**History:**
Percival Pellinore, the Grailknight, is *the* Percival of myth -- member
of Arthur's Round Table, son of Pellinore, questing knight of the Holy Grail.

Although Percival is reluctant to speak of his past, he has told a few that
he swore an oath to find and recover the Chalice of the Last Supper, and
that he would never rest until he had fulfilled said oath.

Either his unflagging devotion to his vow or the divine nature of his mission
have kept him alive, and no older than middle aged, for centuries. Percival's
legend weaves in and out of history -- surfacing in one war only to disappear
for a century after it and reappearing around the world.

In 1963, over 50 years since his last appearance, Percival joined with other
heroes of the time to repell Xana Mega's Fomorian invasion. Percival's offhand
mention of the Table Round led to the formation of these heroes as a team,
the Cosmic Legends of the Universe.

With a tendency to vanish for weeks or years at a time, Percival is at best
a part-time member of the Cosmic Legends, although whenever evil is ascendent, 
he is an implaccable foe and resourceful ally.

**Powers:** Sir Percival has only one confirmed power:
immortality. Due to his vows, he's unable to die until he
completes his quest and finds the Grail.

**Weapons:** 
Although Percival is familiar with modern weaponry, he prefers to use a crossbow
with specially prepared bolts that range from explosive tips to stun charges.

His chainmail is a gift from the Aos Sí and is completely unbreakable, while his
sword, Sequence, is a sister blade to Excalibur from Arthur's arsenal.

**History:**
The Head Librarian has no idea who he is or where he
is from. He awoke in a field outside of Peshawar, Pakistan,
as an adult with no memory of his prior life -- but the 
ability to understand and speak every language he 
encountered. No database on Earth -- digital or analog --
contains any record of the man.

He was instrumental in helping the Cosmic Legends defeat
Glytch's attempts to digitize Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 
accepted an invitation to join the team.

**Powers:**
All information is an open book to the Head Librarian, whether
in printed form, digital, or mental. He can instantly read any
book by touching it, and his psychic powers let him browse
through the thoughts and memories of others as easily as looking
up a definition in a dictionary.

Although he can absorb information at tremendous speeds, his
memory retention is not superhuman. The Librarian can hold only
a few books in memory at once before the information starts to
fade. For this reason, he brings reference materials with him
in the field -- "If I don't know the answer, I can look it up!"
is his motto.

In addition to his purely mental powers, the Head Librarian's
rudimentally telekinetic powers let him lift books off the
ground and move them about.

**History:**
Jack Dee would really rather be doing anything else right now, instead of
saving the world from the latest mystical threat.

The scion of a long line of magical champions, Jack planned to be a lawyer --
not a superhero. Corporate law is just so much more lucrative than 
wizardly troubleshooting.

Even as his mother Maddie founded the Cosmic Legends of the Universe as Miss Magister,
Jack pursued other interests -- even serving as the Cosmic Legends' attorney
at times. 

When Maddie retired from the Cosmic Legends, her brother Johnny Dee -- Jack's uncle -- 
assumed her position as the Master Magister. Johnny's tenure as Master Magister was
cut short by the duplicity of Sequana, who stole his power before taking his life.

Maddie and Jack worked together to avenge Johnny, but the strain was too much for
the elder Dee; with her dying breath, she bequeathed her power and position to
Jack, naming him as the new Master Magister. He currently serves as a reserve member
of the Cosmic Legends, joining as a specialist on missions involving the occult and
supernatural.

**Powers:**
As the Master Magister, Jack Dee's magical powers are limited only by his imagination
and his force of will. He can conjure shields, travel in astral form, cloud the
senses of the weak-willed, and call upon the strength of his ancestral line to
banish evil.

He's also a fairly decent attorney.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
**History:**
For most Earthlings, Obsidius was the first Vulcanor they'd ever
heard of; the inhabitants of the Volcano Isles kept themselves 
isolated for centuries from the primative outside world.

The oldest child of King Tachylus and Queen Limuo, Obsidius was raised
to be the heir to the advanced Vulcanor civilization. From an early
age, he trained with weapons and studied statecraft and the sciences.

While just a young man, Tachylus sent Obsidius as an emissary, first
to meet Titan and then to the outside world in general. Shortly after
the Cosmic Legends were created, he joined as their first non-founding
member.

Obsidius's recklessness as a young man led to several diplomatic
incidents with the outside world, including a tense but brief cold
war with New Zealand.

The ensuing decades have mellowed the crown prince's temper, and he's
regarded as an elder statesman in the superhero community -- to his
amusement, as 75 years of age is still considered young by Vulcanor
standards.

King Tachylus, on the other hand, is no longer a young monarch and is
showing his age. Obsidius's mother, Limuo, has renounced her title
and separated from Tachylus, while their younger child, Igneia, was
exiled for attempting to murder the rest of the Royal Family.

These have put additional stresses on Obsidius to find a spouse and
produce a future successor, if just to prevent Vulcanor from 
descending into a civil war between his many squabbling cousins were
something to happen to the king and prince.

**Powers:**
Like all Vulcanors, Obsidius is superhumanly strong, able to lift several tons
and resist small-arms fire with his stony skin. He's also completely impervious
to heat of any kind.

Obsidius's rank as the Crown Prince gives him limited control over rock and earth, 
although he has done little to actively develop those abilities.

**Weapons:** 
Obsidius Rex's primary weapon is the Lavablade, a greatsword formed
of volcanic steel. In the past he has wielded the Ring of Fire as his 
symbol of rank, but it was destroyed by the Man in Black in 2003.

**History:**
Kelly Liang always loved the sea; while a high school
student in Hawai'i she took a job as a lifeguard, even
though her family was wealthy enough that she didn't
*need* to work.

While working that very job, Kelly was stung by a mutated
jellyfish in the process of saving a drowning woman. 
She managed to make it safely back to shore before from 
the strange toxins in her blood.

Kelly lay in a coma for three weeks, while her parents
saw that she received the best care that money could buy --
including an experimental treatment that brought her
back to consciousness.

Although she was awake, the experience had left her weakened
and barely able to move. Giving up her beloved surfing
hobby, Kelly threw herself into the study of biochemistry
and marine biology, eventually becoming a professor.

Years after her life-changing accident, Kelly managed to
a synthesize a cure for the poisons that ravaged her body --
and also found a strange side effect had given her control
over water!

Dubbing herself Riptide, Liang became a superhero and eventually
was invited to join the Cosmic Legends. She still teaches 
marine biology at the university; Kelly's identity as Riptide is 
an open secret among most Hawai'ians.

But as Riptide is the most prominent and popular superhero 
of Hawai'i, the people of the islands are happy to maintain 
the polite fiction that there's no connection between Professor
Liang and the Hero of Hilo.

**Powers:**
Riptide has complete telekinetic control over liquid water, 
with limited control over ice and water vapor. She can condense
atmospheric water to liquid form, and can instantly melt or
evaporate solid ice.

She can propel herself at speeds up to 100 m.p.h. underwater
or on the surface of a body of water, and 50 m.p.h. over land.

The people of Saturn's moon Titan are not native to the
Solar System; according to their oldest tales, they were
taken from their home planet by a civilization known as
the Visitors, were subjected to scientific experiments, 
and were eventually abandoned on Titan.

Titanians -- known as *Ro'Tan'Okk* in their own language --
have strong mental powers and communicate by telepathy as
often as they use *Ro'Tan'Kesh*. 

They are physically superior to humans, with most able to 
lift over 50 tons with minimal effort. Their only weakness 
is a strong reaction to being touched by salt water, which 
burns them and drains their energy.

There are four known genders among the Titanians; Earthlings
are only familiar with the *nyrr-t'vor* gender thanks to
the presence of Ty'Tonn To'Rezz on Earth. Titanian families
are comprised of 3 or more spouses and their children.

The *Ro'Tan'Okk* have no concepts of war or crime; the
closest thing to a military in Titanian society is the
*Kyl'Sh'Tal* -- the famed Sentinels of Saturn. Sentinels
are astronomers tasked with constant vigilance -- to watch
the skies for the return of the Visitors.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
**History:**
As a young girl, Hazel Montgomery showed a talent for technology
that eventually brought her to the attention of A.L.E.R.T. who tasked
her with analyzing and reverse-engineering Titanian science once
Titan revealed himself to the world.

Eventually she became a field operative for A.L.E.R.T., using a suit 
of armor of her own creation. As Vespa, she was a founding member of
the Cosmic Legends of the Universe; as Hazel Montgomery, she was a
founding director of N.O.V.A. Labs.

Although gifted with science, Montgomery had worse luck when it came
to interpersonal relationships. 

Phineas Pann, her mentor, was revealed as the criminal mastermind 
behind T.R.E.L.A. Her "storybook romance" with Magnus, Marquis
of Vadyvokia, fell apart shortly after the birth of their child Lin.
Delphine Thompson, Hazel's former partner at N.O.V.A., turned to a 
life of villainy as Neutrino. Lin seemingly took a criminal turn
as the Hornette, although this was later revealed to be a ruse.

Montgomery had retired from active duty with the Cosmic Legends
when she sacrificed her life to repel the Visitors' Third Visitation.
Her child Lin adopted the name Vespa 2.0 as an homage to the beloved
heroine.

**Powers:** Hazel Montgomery had no super-powers, just
her brilliant and creative mind.

**Weapons:** 
Hazel's primary weapon was the Vespa armor, designed as rescue and recon gear
for saving lives. Bulletproof and equipped with transparent insect wings, the
Vespa armor served her well for decades, with constant upgrades of weaponry and
sensors.

As a non-binary character who uses they/them pronouns,
Lin Montgomery could be viewed as slightly anachronistic
if firm timelines are followed.

However, this is a bit of authorial license that I'm not
going to lose any sleep over. Maybe the CLU is a slightly
better world than our own in this regard.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**
As the child of Hazel Montgomery, charter member of the
Cosmic Legends of the Universe, and Marquis Malign, regarded by
many as the greatest supervillain of history, Lin Montgomery
carries the weight of a very heavy pedigree in the superhero 
world.

Conceived shortly after their parents wed in secret and before 
Malign's coup propelled him to the throne of Vadyvokia, Lin
grew up surrounded by the Cosmic Legends. To many, they were
the archetypal "kid sidekick" as Bug the Binary Bantling.

Although their first suit of armor was wholly lacking in 
offensive systems, Lin made certain ... *alterations* to the
Bug armor, giving it capabilities beyond merely defensive uses.

Along with their foster brother Del Thompson, Lin formed the
Junior Legends of America; the pair were also the first 
students at the newly chartered Technopolis Academy, and Lin
its first graduate.

Once they had graduated, Lin was contacted by Magnus Malign, who
seemingly convinced them to adopt a villainous persona as
the Hornette and join Villains, Inc. Eventually this cooperation 
was revealed as a ruse that helped bring down VI, 
but it also led to Marquis Malign disowning them and swearing
eternal enmity.

Lin was still operating as the Hornette and serving in the Cosmic
Legends in their mother's stead when the Third Vistation
arrived on Earth and began to process the population of the planet
for abduction to a distant star. 

Only the alliance of the Cosmic Legends, the Junior Legends, 
and Marquis Malign's forces was able repel the Visitors -- and
at the cost of Hazel Montgomery's life.

Shaken by this loss, Lin changed their name to Vespa 2.0 and
rededicated themself to fighting for justice.

**Powers:** Lin Montgomery has no powers; all of their
abilities come from their armored suit. As the crown marquex
of Vadyvokia, Lin may possess some sorcerous potential, but has
never trained those.

**Weapons:** 
Vespa 2.0's armored suit is an evolved version of their mother's, with
advanced microhydraulics and structural reinforcements that let them
lift over 25 tons. A low-power forcefield surrounds the suit, reinforcing
the flimsy-looking plasma wings that generate anti-grav lift.

In addition, Lin sometimes carries a gun that fires electrical and laser
blasts, originally developed during her days as The Hornette.

# Vulcanor {#setting-vulcanor}

::::::::::: place :::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Type of Location:** island chain
- **Location:** South Pacific Ocean
- **Capital:** Volcano City, Vulcanor Island
- **Official Languages:** Vulcanese, English
- **Demonym:** Vulcanor
- **Governance:** Sovereign Monarchy
- **Head of State:** Tachylus Vulcanor Rex (1918 - present)
- **Area:** approx. 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> (386 sq mi) over 14 islands
- **Population:** 100,000 (2010 estimate)
- **Time Zone:** UTC +1400
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The people of Vulcanor are an offshoot of humanity that was
experimented on by the Visitors over 3,000 years ago; their
skin was hardened to a shiny gloss and they were adapted to
live in volcanic conditions. Slaying their Visitor enslavers
and stealing a shuttle craft, they settled on an otherwise
uninhabitable remote chain of islands in the south Pacific.

That distance allowed the Vulcanors time to disassemble and
reverse-engineer many Visitor technologies, including a
compass-scrambling magnetic field that cloaked their islands
from the European colonialist powers.

With the arrival of Titan on Earth in 1956, King Tachylus 
decreed it was time to join the rest of the world and share --
in limited amounts -- their unique technologies. His son
Obsidius was sent as an emissary and later joined the
Cosmic Legends of the Universe.

Excessive heat and volcanic gasses prevent the Vulcanor 
Islands from becoming a vacation destination. While outsiders
are welcomed and treated with respect, few non-Vulcanors have 
been Volcano City.
