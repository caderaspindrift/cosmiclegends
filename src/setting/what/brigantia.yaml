    As a child, Sienna MacGowan heard legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann 
    from her grandmother, and she claimed the Celtic gods even spoke 
    to her in her dreams.
  
    When she grew older, Sienna's dreams faded and she no longer
    believed in the mythological aspects of Celtic fables. Instead,
    she resolved to prove that the Tuatha Dé Danann were historical
    beings as mortal as anyone else. 
  
    Armed with an archaeology degree, Sienna was working late at a 
    digsite outside the village of Skryne, when a voice called out to
    her, asking why she had forgotten her dreams. The experience
    repeated each night, although none save her heard the voice.
  
    Finding no logical explanation for the phenomenon, Sienna replied
    to the voice and asked who was speaking. The goddess Brigit appeared
    before Sienna, told her she was the Champion of the 
    Tuatha Dé Danann, and gifted her with power.

    When Sienna speaks the magic words, *Claidheamh Soluis*, she is
    transformed into the superhumanly powerful Champion, Brigantia.
    Her powers include flight, wisdom, super-speed, super-strength, 
    and projection of light rays from her eyes; in times of great 
    need, she can form a sword of blazing light.

  - text >
      I apologize in advance for the horrible mishandling of the
      Tuatha Dé Danann and other elements of Celtic mythology.
      It's done specifically in reference to the way Marvel Comics
      handled the Norse, Greek, and other pantheons over the years.
