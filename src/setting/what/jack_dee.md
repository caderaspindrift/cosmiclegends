**History:**
Jack Dee would really rather be doing anything else right now, instead of
saving the world from the latest mystical threat.

The scion of a long line of magical champions, Jack planned to be a lawyer --
not a superhero. Corporate law is just so much more lucrative than 
wizardly troubleshooting.

Even as his mother Maddie founded the Cosmic Legends of the Universe as Miss Magister,
Jack pursued other interests -- even serving as the Cosmic Legends' attorney
at times. 

When Maddie retired from the Cosmic Legends, her brother Johnny Dee -- Jack's uncle -- 
assumed her position as the Master Magister. Johnny's tenure as Master Magister was
cut short by the duplicity of Sequana, who stole his power before taking his life.

Maddie and Jack worked together to avenge Johnny, but the strain was too much for
the elder Dee; with her dying breath, she bequeathed her power and position to
Jack, naming him as the new Master Magister. He currently serves as a reserve member
of the Cosmic Legends, joining as a specialist on missions involving the occult and
supernatural.

**Powers:**
As the Master Magister, Jack Dee's magical powers are limited only by his imagination
and his force of will. He can conjure shields, travel in astral form, cloud the
senses of the weak-willed, and call upon the strength of his ancestral line to
banish evil.

He's also a fairly decent attorney.
