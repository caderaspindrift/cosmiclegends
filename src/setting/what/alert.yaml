      The Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats (A.L.E.R.T.)
      was created by the U.S. Congress sometime after World War II and before Titan's
      arrival on Earth in October of 1956 -- as they were well-equipped to handle
      the Saturnian Sentinel, had it proven necessary.

      A.L.E.R.T. usually works with the Cosmic Legends, although the two groups have 
      clashed in the past -- most notably when A.L.E.R.T. was infiltrated by agents 
      of T.R.E.L.A.
