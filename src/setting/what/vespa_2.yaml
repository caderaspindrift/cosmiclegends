      As a non-binary character who uses they/them pronouns,
      Lin Montgomery could be viewed as slightly anachronistic
      if firm timelines are followed.
      
      However, this is a bit of authorial license that I'm not
      going to lose any sleep over. Maybe the CLU is a slightly
      better world than our own in this regard.
- history: |
    As the child of Hazel Montgomery, charter member of the
    Cosmic Legends of the Universe, and Marquis Malign, regarded by
    many as the greatest supervillain of history, Lin Montgomery
    carries the weight of a very heavy pedigree in the superhero 
    world.
    
    Conceived shortly after their parents wed in secret and before 
    Malign's coup propelled him to the throne of Vadyvokia, Lin
    grew up surrounded by the Cosmic Legends. To many, they were
    the archetypal "kid sidekick" as Bug the Binary Bantling.
    
    Although their first suit of armor was wholly lacking in 
    offensive systems, Lin made certain ... *alterations* to the
    Bug armor, giving it capabilities beyond merely defensive uses.
    
    Along with their foster brother Del Thompson, Lin formed the
    Junior Legends of America; the pair were also the first 
    students at the newly chartered Technopolis Academy, and Lin
    its first graduate.
    
    Once they had graduated, Lin was contacted by Magnus Malign, who
    seemingly convinced them to adopt a villainous persona as
    the Hornette and join Villains, Inc. Eventually this cooperation 
    was revealed as a ruse that helped bring down VI, 
    but it also led to Marquis Malign disowning them and swearing
    eternal enmity.
    
    Lin was still operating as the Hornette and serving in the Cosmic
    Legends in their mother's stead when the Third Vistation
    arrived on Earth and began to process the population of the planet
    for abduction to a distant star. 
    
    Only the alliance of the Cosmic Legends, the Junior Legends, 
    and Marquis Malign's forces was able repel the Visitors -- and
    at the cost of Hazel Montgomery's life.
  
    Shaken by this loss, Lin changed their name to Vespa 2.0 and
    rededicated themself to fighting for justice.
- powers: >
    Lin Montgomery has no powers; all of their
    abilities come from their armored suit. As the crown marquex
    of Vadyvokia, Lin may possess some sorcerous potential, but has
    never trained those.
- weapons: |
    Vespa 2.0's armored suit is an evolved version of their mother's, with
    advanced microhydraulics and structural reinforcements that let them
    lift over 25 tons. A low-power forcefield surrounds the suit, reinforcing
    the flimsy-looking plasma wings that generate anti-grav lift.
  
    In addition, Lin sometimes carries a gun that fires electrical and laser
    blasts, originally developed during her days as The Hornette.
