  - history: >
      The *Fir Domnann* people -- collectively known as the 
      Tuatha Dé Danann --
      are powerful extradimensional entities once worshipped as gods by the 
      Celts. They grant a portion of their power to a mortal human who becomes
      their Champion; the current Champion is Sienna MacGowan, otherwise 
      known as Brigantia of the Cosmic Legends.

      I apologize in advance for the horrible mishandling of the 
      Tuatha Dé Danann and other elements of Celtic mythology.
      It's done specifically in reference to the way Marvel Comics
      handled the Norse, Greek, and other pantheons over the years.
