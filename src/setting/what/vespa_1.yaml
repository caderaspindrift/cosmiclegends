- history: |
    As a young girl, Hazel Montgomery showed a talent for technology
    that eventually brought her to the attention of A.L.E.R.T. who tasked
    her with analyzing and reverse-engineering Titanian science once
    Titan revealed himself to the world.
      
    Eventually she became a field operative for A.L.E.R.T., using a suit 
    of armor of her own creation. As Vespa, she was a founding member of
    the Cosmic Legends of the Universe; as Hazel Montgomery, she was a
    founding director of N.O.V.A. Labs.
    
    Although gifted with science, Montgomery had worse luck when it came
    to interpersonal relationships. 
    
    Phineas Pann, her mentor, was revealed as the criminal mastermind 
    behind T.R.E.L.A. Her "storybook romance" with Magnus, Marquis
    of Vadyvokia, fell apart shortly after the birth of their child Lin.
    Delphine Thompson, Hazel's former partner at N.O.V.A., turned to a 
    life of villainy as Neutrino. Lin seemingly took a criminal turn
    as the Hornette, although this was later revealed to be a ruse.
    
    Montgomery had retired from active duty with the Cosmic Legends
    when she sacrificed her life to repel the Visitors' Third Visitation.
    Her child Lin adopted the name Vespa 2.0 as an homage to the beloved
    heroine.
- powers: |
    Hazel Montgomery had no super-powers, just her brilliant and creative mind.
- weapons: |
    Hazel's primary weapon was the Vespa armor, designed as rescue and recon gear
    for saving lives. Bulletproof and equipped with transparent insect wings, the
    Vespa armor served her well for decades, with constant upgrades of weaponry and
    sensors.
