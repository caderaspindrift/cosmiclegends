- history > 
In 1971, the **Network for Observation, Verification, and Analysis**
was founded in Technopolis by Titan, Vespa (I), Dr. Phineas Pann, 
Delphine Thompson, and King Tachylus Rex of Vulcanor. 

Since then, major research laboratories have been established in 9 other cities. 

N.O.V.A. Labs are a helpful resource for scientific-minded heroes, 
but there's always the risk of science gone wild.
