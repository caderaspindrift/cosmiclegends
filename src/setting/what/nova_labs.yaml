- history: | 
    In 1971, the **Network for Observation, Verification, and Analysis**
    was founded in Technopolis by Titan, Vespa (I), Dr. Phineas Pann, 
    Delphine Thompson, and King Tachylus Rex of Vulcanor. 
    
    Since then, major research laboratories have been established in 9 other cities. 
    
    N.O.V.A. Labs are a helpful resource for scientific-minded heroes, 
    but there's always the risk of science gone wild.
