**History:**
For most Earthlings, Obsidius was the first Vulcanor they'd ever
heard of; the inhabitants of the Volcano Isles kept themselves 
isolated for centuries from the primative outside world.

The oldest child of King Tachylus and Queen Limuo, Obsidius was raised
to be the heir to the advanced Vulcanor civilization. From an early
age, he trained with weapons and studied statecraft and the sciences.

While just a young man, Tachylus sent Obsidius as an emissary, first
to meet Titan and then to the outside world in general. Shortly after
the Cosmic Legends were created, he joined as their first non-founding
member.

Obsidius's recklessness as a young man led to several diplomatic
incidents with the outside world, including a tense but brief cold
war with New Zealand.

The ensuing decades have mellowed the crown prince's temper, and he's
regarded as an elder statesman in the superhero community -- to his
amusement, as 75 years of age is still considered young by Vulcanor
standards.

King Tachylus, on the other hand, is no longer a young monarch and is
showing his age. Obsidius's mother, Limuo, has renounced her title
and separated from Tachylus, while their younger child, Igneia, was
exiled for attempting to murder the rest of the Royal Family.

These have put additional stresses on Obsidius to find a spouse and
produce a future successor, if just to prevent Vulcanor from 
descending into a civil war between his many squabbling cousins were
something to happen to the king and prince.

**Powers:**
Like all Vulcanors, Obsidius is superhumanly strong, able to lift several tons
and resist small-arms fire with his stony skin. He's also completely impervious
to heat of any kind.

Obsidius's rank as the Crown Prince gives him limited control over rock and earth, 
although he has done little to actively develop those abilities.

**Weapons:** 
Obsidius Rex's primary weapon is the Lavablade, a greatsword formed
of volcanic steel. In the past he has wielded the Ring of Fire as his 
symbol of rank, but it was destroyed by the Man in Black in 2003.
