- history: |+
    Martin McCord never wanted to become the world's first
    One-Officer-Police-Force, but a near-fatal shootout took
    that choice away from him. Seconds away from dying, his injured
    brain was transplanted into the ADAM-42 android body, saving
    his life and trapping him in a metal form physically superior
    to, and distinctively less functional than, his original human body.

    Officially, McCord is dead -- but with the right prosthetic mask,
    he can pass among humans as Adam Lii, the newest recruit of the
    Los Angeles Police Department.
