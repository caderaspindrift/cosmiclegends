## Lin's Gender

As a non-binary character who uses they/them pronouns,
Lin Montgomery could be viewed as slightly anachronistic
if firm timelines are followed.

However, this is a bit of authorial license that I'm not
going to lose any sleep over. Maybe the CLU is a slightly
better world than our own in this regard.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**
As the child of Hazel Montgomery, charter member of the
Cosmic Legends of the Universe, and Marquis Malign, regarded by
many as the greatest supervillain of history, Lin Montgomery
carries the weight of a very heavy pedigree in the superhero 
world.

Conceived shortly after their parents wed in secret and before 
Malign's coup propelled him to the throne of Vadyvokia, Lin
grew up surrounded by the Cosmic Legends. To many, they were
the archetypal "kid sidekick" as Bug the Binary Bantling.

Although their first suit of armor was wholly lacking in 
offensive systems, Lin made certain ... *alterations* to the
Bug armor, giving it capabilities beyond merely defensive uses.

Along with their foster brother Del Thompson, Lin formed the
Junior Legends of America; the pair were also the first 
students at the newly chartered Technopolis Academy, and Lin
its first graduate.

Once they had graduated, Lin was contacted by Magnus Malign, who
seemingly convinced them to adopt a villainous persona as
the Hornette and join Villains, Inc. Eventually this cooperation 
was revealed as a ruse that helped bring down VI, 
but it also led to Marquis Malign disowning them and swearing
eternal enmity.

Lin was still operating as the Hornette and serving in the Cosmic
Legends in their mother's stead when the Third Vistation
arrived on Earth and began to process the population of the planet
for abduction to a distant star. 

Only the alliance of the Cosmic Legends, the Junior Legends, 
and Marquis Malign's forces was able repel the Visitors -- and
at the cost of Hazel Montgomery's life.

Shaken by this loss, Lin changed their name to Vespa 2.0 and
rededicated themself to fighting for justice.

**Powers:** Lin Montgomery has no powers; all of their
abilities come from their armored suit. As the crown marquex
of Vadyvokia, Lin may possess some sorcerous potential, but has
never trained those.

**Weapons:** 
Vespa 2.0's armored suit is an evolved version of their mother's, with
advanced microhydraulics and structural reinforcements that let them
lift over 25 tons. A low-power forcefield surrounds the suit, reinforcing
the flimsy-looking plasma wings that generate anti-grav lift.

In addition, Lin sometimes carries a gun that fires electrical and laser
blasts, originally developed during her days as The Hornette.
