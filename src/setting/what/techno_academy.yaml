  - history: | 
      Technopolis Academy was established in November 1980 to train 
      young superheroes in the use of their powers and abilities. 
    
      The first two students were Bug (now known as Vespa 2.0) and Energy Boy;
      Glytch is the Academy's biggest shame, as they turned to a life of digital 
      crime even while studying at Techno-A.
    
      Most of the Academy students who have had basic crisis training go on to
      join the Junior Legends of America. Of those, Bug II, Energy Boy, and 
      Vespa 2.0 have gone on to the core Cosmic Legends team, although Bug is 
      not currently an active member.
