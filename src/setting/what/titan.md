**Powers:**
Titan is perhaps the most powerful individual on the planet.
His Titanian strength lets him lift well over 100 tons, and he is
able to project the cold frost of the Titanian sky from his
eyes as energy beams. Flight, speed, and telepathy round out his
vast array of alien powers -- which are exceptional even for a
Titanian.
