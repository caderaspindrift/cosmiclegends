- history: |
    "Don Wright was a publisher of Daily Bulletin, a newspaper based 
    in New York City. He put on a costume to help the downtrodden and 
    oppressed. 
    
    When World War II broke out, he focused on fighting the Axis 
    saboteurs. He was aided by the Young Defenders, four children named 
    Lefty, Slim, Beanie, and Joanie, who worked as newsboys 
    for the Daily Bulletin.

    In October 1942, Captain Freedom teamed up with Shock Gibson, Black 
    Cat, War Nurse and Ted Parrish to repel the Japanese attempt to 
    invade Los Angeles. He also teamed up with Black Cat and Shock Gibson 
    on several other occasions."
- powers: |
    "Captain Freedom originally displayed super-strength and limited flight, 
    but those powers vanished shortly after his original adventures and he 
    remained non-powered for the remainder of his adventures."
