    "John Battle, a veteran of World War I, saw that another war was 
    coming and decided to stop it before it could happen.

    happen to anyone else. He set up a laboratory on top of a mountain 
    and began fighting against warmongers. 
    
    Besides his various assistants, such as his secretary Jane Lorrain, 
    he was partnered with his son, Captain Battle Jr. and sidekick,
