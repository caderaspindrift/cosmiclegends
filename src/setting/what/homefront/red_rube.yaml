- history: |
    "Rueben Rueben was a young orphan who ran away from the 
    orphanage. He hid out in an old castle, but discovered it 
    was his ancestor's home. His ancestors still haunted the 
    castle as ghosts, all sharing the same name as their 
    descendant, and wanted to help him.

    Rueben later became a cub reporter for the Daily Sun."
- powers: |
    "The ghosts each gave him the powers they possessed in 
    life: strength, wisdom, speed, invulnerability, and courage. 
    All he needed to do to use these powers was call out \"Hey Rube\" 
    and he would transform into Red Rube, a fully grown hero."
