- history: |
    "Pat Parker was a young British nurse from Doville, a quiet 
    village near London. When her town came under Nazi bombardment, 
    she was able to use her skills to help the wounded children. 
    
    Shortly afterwords, she overhears Nazi agents plotting an attack 
    against the British navy. Angered by what happened to her village 
    and eager to prevent any further devastation, she decided to take 
    matters into her own hands. After helping the Royal Air Force beat 
    back the Nazi assault, she joined her country's military as a nurse.

    Later, went on to form the Girl Commandos.

    Her love interest was British pilot Don Fraser."
