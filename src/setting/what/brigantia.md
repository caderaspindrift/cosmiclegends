**History:**
As a child, Sienna MacGowan heard legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann 
from her grandmother, and she claimed the Celtic gods even spoke 
to her in her dreams.

When she grew older, Sienna's dreams faded and she no longer
believed in the mythological aspects of Celtic fables. Instead,
she resolved to prove that the Tuatha Dé Danann were historical
beings as mortal as anyone else. 

Armed with an archaeology degree, Sienna was working late at a 
digsite outside the village of Skryne, when a voice called out to
her, asking why she had forgotten her dreams. The experience
repeated each night, although none save her heard the voice.

Finding no logical explanation for the phenomenon, Sienna replied
to the voice and asked who was speaking. The goddess Brigit appeared
before Sienna, told her she was the Champion of the 
Tuatha Dé Danann, and gifted her with power.

**Powers:**
When Sienna speaks the magic words, *Claidheamh Soluis*, she is
transformed into the superhumanly powerful Champion, Brigantia.
Her powers include flight, wisdom, super-speed, super-strength, 
and projection of light rays from her eyes; in times of great 
need, she can form a sword of blazing light.
