**History:**
The Head Librarian has no idea who he is or where he
is from. He awoke in a field outside of Peshawar, Pakistan,
as an adult with no memory of his prior life -- but the 
ability to understand and speak every language he 
encountered. No database on Earth -- digital or analog --
contains any record of the man.

He was instrumental in helping the Cosmic Legends defeat
Glytch's attempts to digitize Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 
accepted an invitation to join the team.

**Powers:**
All information is an open book to the Head Librarian, whether
in printed form, digital, or mental. He can instantly read any
book by touching it, and his psychic powers let him browse
through the thoughts and memories of others as easily as looking
up a definition in a dictionary.

Although he can absorb information at tremendous speeds, his
memory retention is not superhuman. The Librarian can hold only
a few books in memory at once before the information starts to
fade. For this reason, he brings reference materials with him
in the field -- "If I don't know the answer, I can look it up!"
is his motto.

In addition to his purely mental powers, the Head Librarian's
rudimentally telekinetic powers let him lift books off the
ground and move them about.
