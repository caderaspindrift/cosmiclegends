Jeri North's exposure to *bremsstrahlung* rays fundamentally changed
the nature of her body. Her skin is a rough, rocky substance with
sharp metal "hairs" scattered about, and her internal organs and skeleton
are composed of even denser materials.

This grants her a high degree of imperviousness to pain and injury,
and lets her lift in excess of 100 tons.
