    Jeri North's exposure to *bremsstrahlung* rays fundamentally changed
    the nature of her body. Her skin is a rough, rocky substance with
    sharp metal "hairs" scattered about, and her internal organs and skeleton
    are composed of even denser materials.
    
    This grants her a high degree of imperviousness to pain and injury,
    and lets her lift in excess of 100 tons.
