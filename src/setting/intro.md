# The Official Handbook of the Cosmic Legends Universe {#toc-setting .breakbefore}

The follow section offers a default setting for []{.gamename}, although
you certainly don't have to use it to play this game! 

Our assumption is that you'll use []{.gamename} to tell stories set in 
either a superhero universe of your own devising, or an existing
universe from comics, television, novels, or movies.

But you might not -- especially if you're running a One-Shot, or if you
just want to get start quickly. In that case, you're definitely welcome
to use the Cosmic Legends Universe (CLU) however you wish.

What follows is a faux-encyclopedia for the CLU, in the style of similar
handbooks created by major comics publishers. Complete game stats are
provided for the ten example characters pictured in the class writeups
earlier in this book.

## Which Era? {#toc-setting-era}

A few of the following entries reference a specific time period or 
year. There are several ways you can handle such dates:

Set Your Game in 1985

:   []{.gamename} isn't necessarily mean to be period-piece game,
    but there's nothing that says you can't play it that way.

    Any date in the Bronze Age of comics works, 
    but 1985 is a nice round number that you can use as the "current
    year."

    If you choose this approach, just accept all dates as written.

Adjust the Timeline

:   There aren't any fixed points in time in the CLU timeline. 

    If you want Titan to arrive on Earth in 2013 or N.O.V.A. Labs to 
    be a late-90s dotcom startup, that's perfectly fine! 

    Cross out the years -- figuratively or literally --
    and write in the new ones. It's your Series!

Assume Comic Book Time

:   Everyone knows that characters in superhero comic books don't age
    like the rest of us.  
    
    If you take this approach, you assume that 
    all exact dates refer to hypothetical publishing dates of 
    non-existent comics, but the real dates follow a sliding timeline. 

    Titan arrived on Earth 29
    years ago, the Cosmic Legends formed 22 years ago, and Technopolis
    Academy was created 5 years ago.

Create a Modern Age

:   If you want to leave the dates where they are *and* still play in
    the 2020s (or whenever you're reading []{.gamename}), you can!

    Assume that everything described here happened up until 1985 or
    so, and that the last 35 or 40 years of CLU history haven't been
    recorded.

    You get to make up whatever happens during that time period, and
    the heroes and villains active in current times will probably
    be very different from those listed here -- for example, Lin
    Montgomery would be over 50; is there a Vespa 3.0 active?

Don't Sweat It.
    
:   This option is basically saying that you don't worry that much 
    about exact dates; it's just not that important in your Series.

    There's nothing wrong with just ignoring dates entirely.

Who decides which option to use? Ideally this would be part of a
Session 0 discussion, and if an option requires work -- such as 
making up several decades of superhero history -- that should be
split among the players and not dumped *solely* on the Editor.

That said, it's also possible for the Editor to propose an era
when pitching the game to the other players. You could even set
your Series in a "historical" period in the CLU, such as the
mid-1960s heyday of the Silver Age Cosmic Legends.

## Customizing the Setting {#toc-setting-customize}

Although we do provide enough of a framework for you to get
started, the CLU isn't a fully realized superhero universe.

This is deliberate -- because *your heroes* are the stars
of the story in your Series, not whatever lore we wrote when
putting []{.gamename} together.

There aren't any other superhero teams listed -- to give you
room to insert your own. 

The current state of the Cosmic Legends team isn't detailed -- 
so that your hero team can establish themselves as Earth's 
mightiest heroes. Are you allies or are you rivals?

If you want to take out some of the hokier parts of the Bronze
Age-style setting, feel free -- you can edit away anything you
want in your Series. You don't even have to have the Cosmic
Legends in the Cosmic Legends universe. What if they never
formed?

## Playing as the Cosmic Legends {#toc-setting-clotu}

Another approach is to just play the 
**Cosmic Legends of the Universe** team themselves. 

There are complete stats for each "current" and "reserve" 
member -- and you can download filled-out hero sheets
from the []{.gamename} site at 
[spindrift.games/clotu](https://spindrift.games/clotu).
This is good for One-Shots or even prequel stories.

If you want to make up your own heroes, they could be the
**All-Different New Cosmic Legends** -- nearly
every superhero team in comic books had a point where their
roster underwent major change. 

Retire or kill off the lore CLotU members, or keep them as 
mentors and reserve members -- just remember your new heroes
are the stars.

And there's nothing stopping you from combining these --
some players using the "established" CLotU members, while
others make "All-Different" new heroes.

### The Junior Legends of America {#toc-setting-jloa}

If you want to play in the Cosmic Legends universe as younger
heroes, the **Junior Legends of America** are an official 
auxillary of the CLotU comprised of teen heroes, students at 
Technopolis Academy, and former sidekicks. 

Unlike the "current" CLotU members, JLoAers don't receive a
full writeup and some are just mentioned in passing.

To reflect the younger age of JLoA members compared to adult 
superheroes, you can use any or all of these optional rules:

Reduced Skills

:   Young heroes likely don't have professional jobs or
    experience doing much beyond going to school. 

    To reflect this, replace two of the **Skills** you'd choose
    with **Academic** instead.

Undeveloped Powers

:   While younger heroes might have the same amount of raw
    power as their older counterparts, they may lack
    experience in use those powers in creative ways.

    You can reflect this by picking two fewer **Personal Power Words** 
    when you create your hero.

No Crisis Training

:   Every new hero gets a choice of one Fighting Style that
    reflects their strategies in a Crisis. But younger heroes
    may still be learning that -- it's one of the primary
    non-academic topics at Technopolis Academy.

    Therefore, no young heroes start off knowing a **Fighting Style**, 
    with the exception of a young Knight -- a Squire? -- who gets one.

These optional rules are *only* intended for a Series that
focuses exclusively on younger heroes.

If you're playing a young hero in a Series with adult heroes,
*don't* use the rules above -- create your hero normally, with
the same rules used by everyone else.

Naturally, you can use these optional rules if you're playing
young heroes of your own creation, either in the Cosmic Legends
or elsewhere.
