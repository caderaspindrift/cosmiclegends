CODE OF THE COMICS MAGAZINE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC.

Adopted October 26, 1954

PREAMBLE

The comic-book medium, having come of age on the American cultural scene, 
must measure up to its responsibilities.

Constantly improving techniques and higher standards go hand in hand with 
these responsibilities.

To make a positive contribution to contemporary life, the industry must seek 
new areas for developing sound, wholesome entertainment. The people 
responsible for writing, drawing, printing, publishing, and selling comic 
books have done a commendable job in the past, and have been striving toward 
this goal.

Their record of progress and continuing improvement compares favorably with 
other media in the communications industry. An outstanding example is the 
development of comic books as a unique and effective tool for instruction and 
education. Comic books have also made their contribution in the field of 
letters and criticism of contemporary life.

In keeping with the American tradition, the members of this industry will and 
must continue to work together in the future.

In the same tradition, members of the industry must see to it that gains made 
in this medium are not lost and that violations of standards of good taste, 
which might tend toward corruption of the comic book as an instructive and 
wholesome form of entertainment, will be eliminated.

Therefore, the Comics Magazine Association of America, Inc. has adopted this 
code, and placed strong powers of enforcement in the hands of an independent 
code authority.

Further, members of the association have endorsed the purpose and spirit of 
this code as a vital instrument to the growth of the industry.

To this end, they have pledged themselves to conscientiously adhere to its 
principles and to abide by all decisions based on the code made by the 
administrator.

They are confident that this positive and forthright statement will provide an 
effective bulwark for the protection and enhancement of the American reading 
public, and that it will become a landmark in the history of self-regulation 
for the entire communications industry.
