# Approaches {#soapbox-approaches}

These Approaches -- named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles --
were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not 
any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. 
A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, 
or as wise or charming as they like.

The other reason for these Approaches is that the concept of Intelligence 
as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. 
It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, 
including racial and class injustice. 

We chose “Detective" as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve 
problems by thinking about them and gathering information, 
not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.

# Approaches {#toc-approaches}

Each hero's nature is defined by their scores in 5 different Approaches, 
which represent their preferred methods to solve problems.

::::::::::::::: {.chargen-list } ::::::::::::::
- **Action** - a direct, straight-forward approach
- **Adventure** - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations
- **Detective** - a logical approach, based on gathering information
- **Mystery** - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions
- **Suspense** - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Each of your hero's Approaches starts with a score of 1, and you have 5 
additional points to distribute to them.
