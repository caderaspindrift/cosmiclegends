# Power Words {#toc-powers }

Your hero has a list of words called Power Words that define their
super-powers and how they use them. Power Words are used in three
different ways:

:::::::::::: {.chargen-list } :::::::::::::::::::::
- A **Power Display**, which uses a single Power Word
- A **Power Stunt**, using two (or more) Power Words
- A **Power Combo**, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are four types of Power Words:

:::::::::: {.chargen-list } :::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Core Power Words**, unique to your class
- **Personal Power Words**, picked from your class list
- **Nova Power Words**, unique to your hero
- **Scene Power Words**, based on the situation
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Core Power Words {#toc-power-words-core}

When you create your hero, you have two **Core Power Words** 
common to all members of your class. 
You don't have to choose them; you get them automatically.

## Personal Power Words {#toc-power-words-personal}

In addition to Core Power Words, your hero also has 6 Personal Power Words. 
When you create your hero, choose these 6 from 
your class's list of 15 Personal Power Words. 
(If your class is Paragon, pick an extra one
from your class, and another from any class's list.)

## Nova Power Words {#toc-power-words-nova}

Your **Nova Power Powers** can be anything; you're encouraged to use your 
Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.  

Like Ideals, you can choose any two words you like for
your hero's Nova Power Words.

Nova Power Words might look like this:

:::::::: {.chargen-list .twocolumn} ::::::::::::::::::::
- **Soaring Dragon**
- **Berserker Rage**
- **Indomitable Spirit**
- **Solar Flare**
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you've checked off each of your hero's Ideals, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Storyline.

## Scene Power Words {#toc-power-words-scene}

Each scene where a Crisis takes places has up to 6 Power Words
that describe the environment around your heroes. 
These are known as **Scene Power Words.**

The Editor comes up with Scene Power Words when describing a location, 
and if you think creatively, you can use them in your Power Stunts and Combos.
