# [Abilities and Ability Categories]{#toc-ability-categories}

At the start of each Volume, you can choose one ability from your class
or from the list of Generic Abilities; before Volume One, you can choose
two abilities from either your class list or the list of Generic Abilities.

Each ability can be chosen only once, unless otherwise noted.
You can't choose an ability if you already have that ability or a
variant of that ability.

There are four categories of abilities that all use similar mechanics:

- **Arsenal Abilities** let you pick a number of single-use Core
  Power Words at the start of a Storyline;
- **Crossover Abilities** give you access to Power Words (and, usually,
  abilities) from another class;
- **Hero Cave Abilities** give you a personal headquarters where
  you can store your trophies or use your skills;
- **Pet Abilities** let you have an animal companion, familiar,
  or special pet that accompanies you.

For **Arsenal**, **Hero Cave**, and **Pet** Abilities, the following
rules apply:

- You can have only one ability of each type; every ability of a certain
  type is considered to be a variant ability of all other abilities of
  that type.
- Thus you can have only one Arsenal ability, one Hero Cave ability, 
  and one Pet ability.

For **Crossover** Abilities, the following rules apply:

- Each Crossover Ability is tied to a specific class;
- You can't already be a member of that class (including via 
  Multi-Class or Dual-Class options);
- You can't take a second Crossover Ability tied to that class.
- Some Crossover Abilities let you take abilities from that
  class instead of your own class; however, ...
- You can't take a Crossover Ability as a result of another
  Crossover Ability. For example, if you take a Crossover (Mage)
  Ability that lets you take a Mage class ability instead of one
  of your class abilities, you can't take a Mage class ability
  that's a Crossover ability itself.
