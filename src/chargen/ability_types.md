# [Abilities and Ability Categories]{#toc-ability-types .colbefore}

At the start of each Volume, you can choose one ability from your 
class or from the list of Generic Abilities; before Volume One, 
you can choose two abilities from either your class list or the 
list of Generic Abilities.

Each ability can be chosen only once, unless otherwise noted with
a *Repetition* statement.

You can't choose an ability if you already have that ability or a
variant of that ability. 

A *variant* is any ability that says "This is a variant of *another 
ability.*", or any ability with the same name as another ability
that you already have.

There are four categories of abilities, where each ability of that
type uses similar game rules and mechanics:

- **Arsenal Abilities** let you pick a number of single-use Core
  Power Words at the start of a Storyline;
- You can only have one *Arsenal Ability*; all Arsenal Abilities
  are considered variants of all other Arsenal Abilities;
- **Crossover Abilities** give you access to Power Words (and, usually,
  abilities) from another class;
- **Hero Cave Abilities** give you a personal headquarters where
  you can store your trophies or use your skills;
- You can only have one *Hero Cave Ability*; all Hero Cave Abilities
  are considered variants of all other Hero Cave Abilities;
- **Pet Abilities** let you have an animal companion, familiar,
  or special pet that accompanies you;
- You can only have one *Pet Ability*; all Pet Abilities are 
  considered variants of all other Pet Abilities.

For **Crossover** Abilities, the following rules apply:

- Each Crossover Ability is tied to a specific class;
- You can't already be a member of that class (including via 
  Multi-Class or Dual-Class options);
- You can't take a second Crossover Ability tied to that class.
- Some Crossover Abilities let you take abilities from that
  class instead of your own class; however, ...
- You can't take a Crossover Ability as a result of another
  Crossover Ability. For example, if you take a Crossover (Mage)
  Ability that lets you take a Mage class ability instead of one
  of your class abilities, you can't take a Mage class ability
  that's a Crossover ability itself (of another class).
