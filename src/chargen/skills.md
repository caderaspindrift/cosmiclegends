When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as
determined by your class, which may also give additional skills.

Keep in mind that []{.gamename} is a four-color game, not a simulation
of reality -- so skills follow "comic book logic" rather than working
as they really *should* in real life.

## Skill Descriptions

The skills in []{.gamename} are listed below, along with 3 to 5 ways
of using those with your hero's Facets and suggestions the Editor can
propose on an Edge Success.
