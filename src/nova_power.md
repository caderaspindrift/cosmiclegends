# Nova Power {#toc-nova-power}

Like Motivations, you can choose any two words you like for
your hero's Nova Power Words.

When you complete your Motivations list, you have access to those 
two Power Words, which you can use separately or collectively in
Power Stunts until the current Story Arc is over.

Your Nova Power can be anything; you're encouraged to use your Nova
Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.  
Nova Power Words might look like this:

- Soaring Dragon
- Berserker Rage
- Indomitable Spirit
- Solar Flare
