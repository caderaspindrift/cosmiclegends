<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-chargen">Hero Origin</h2>
<p>To create your hero, you just follow these steps:</p>
<div class="chargen-list">
<ol type="1">
<li>Pick a <strong>Class</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gain 2 <strong>Core Power Words</strong></li>
<li>Pick six <strong>Personal Power Words</strong> from your Class list</li>
<li>Choose 2 words as your <strong>Nova Power Words</strong></li>
<li>Pick your <strong>Skills</strong>, based on your Class</li>
<li>Pick a <strong>Volume</strong> 1 ability from your Class</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assign 1 point to each <strong>Approach</strong>, then distribute more 5 points as you wish</li>
<li>Pick a <strong>Fighting Style</strong></li>
<li>Choose 5 words as <strong>Ideals</strong></li>
<li>Describe a <strong>Storyline</strong> you’d like to play out with your hero</li>
<li>Choose your hero’s <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Pronouns</strong>, and <strong>Looks</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="toc-powers">Power Words</h3>
<p>Your hero has a list of words called Power Words that define their super-powers and how they use them. Power Words are used in three different ways:</p>
<div class="chargen-list">
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Power Display</strong>, which uses a single Power Word</li>
<li>A <strong>Power Stunt</strong>, using two (or more) Power Words</li>
<li>A <strong>Power Combo</strong>, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>There are four types of Power Words:</p>
<div class="chargen-list">
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Power Words</strong>, unique to your class</li>
<li><strong>Personal Power Words</strong>, picked from your class list</li>
<li><strong>Nova Power Words</strong>, unique to your hero</li>
<li><strong>Scene Power Words</strong>, based on the situation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-core">Core Power Words</h4>
<p>When you create your hero, you have two <strong>Core Power Words</strong> common to all members of your class. You don’t have to choose them; you get them automatically.</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-personal">Personal Power Words</h4>
<p>In addition to Core Power Words, your hero also has 6 Personal Power Words. When you create your hero, choose these 6 from your class’s list of 15 Personal Power Words. (If your class is Paragon, pick an extra one from your class, and another from any class’s list.)</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-nova">Nova Power Words</h4>
<p>Your <strong>Nova Power Powers</strong> can be anything; you’re encouraged to use your Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.</p>
<p>Like Ideals, you can choose any two words you like for your hero’s Nova Power Words.</p>
<p>Nova Power Words might look like this:</p>
<div class="chargen-list twocolumn">
<ul>
<li><strong>Soaring Dragon</strong></li>
<li><strong>Berserker Rage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Indomitable Spirit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Solar Flare</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When you’ve checked off each of your hero’s Ideals, you unlock your <strong>Nova Power Words</strong> and can use them until the end of the current Storyline.</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-scene">Scene Power Words</h4>
<p>Each scene where a Crisis takes places has up to 6 Power Words that describe the environment around your heroes. These are known as <strong>Scene Power Words.</strong></p>
<p>The Editor comes up with Scene Power Words when describing a location, and if you think creatively, you can use them in your Power Stunts and Combos.</p>
<section id="approaches" class="soapbox approaches">
<h3>Approaches</h3>
<p>These Approaches – named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles – were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, or as wise or charming as they like.</p>
<p>The other reason for these Approaches is that the concept of Intelligence as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, including racial and class injustice.</p>
<p>We chose “Detective” as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve problems by thinking about them and gathering information, not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="toc-approaches">Approaches</h3>
<p>Each hero’s nature is defined by their scores in 5 different Approaches, which represent their preferred methods to solve problems.</p>
<div class="chargen-list">
<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong> - a direct, straight-forward approach</li>
<li><strong>Adventure</strong> - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations</li>
<li><strong>Detective</strong> - a logical approach, based on gathering information</li>
<li><strong>Mystery</strong> - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions</li>
<li><strong>Suspense</strong> - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Each of your hero’s Approaches starts with a score of 1, and you have 5 additional points to distribute to them.</p>
<h3 id="toc-fighting-style">Fighting Style</h3>
<p>Your hero specializes in one style of fighting, whether they attack with their fists or their powers. Those styles are:</p>
<div class="chargen-list breakable">
<ul>
<li><strong>Acrobat</strong> Reduce by 1 the cost to counter a Crisis move targeting only you.</li>
<li><strong>Brawler</strong> Add 2 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal.</li>
<li><strong>Controller</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a Power to advance the Outwit goal.</li>
<li><strong>Frenzy</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a Power to advance the Smash Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Interceptor</strong> Reduce by 1 the cost to Take the Hit for someone else.</li>
<li><strong>Martial Artist</strong> Add 2 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Outwit goal.</li>
<li><strong>Mediator</strong> Add 1 die when you advance the Allay Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Rescuer</strong> Add 1 die when you advance the Rescue Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Sharpshooter</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a ranged Weapon to advance the Smash goal.</li>
<li><strong>Tactician</strong> Add 2 dice when you add to the Teamwork Pool.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Master</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a melee Weapon to advance the Outwit goal.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you choose the Knight class, you get to pick an additional fighting style.</p>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="toc-ideals">Ideals</h3>
<p>Your hero has five Ideals that drive them to feats of heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen by you when you create your hero; there’s no set list.</p>
<p>For example, one hero could have these five Ideals:</p>
<div class="chargen-list twocolumn">
<ul>
<li><strong>Truth</strong></li>
<li><strong>Justice</strong></li>
<li><strong>Responsibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Restraint</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When you use all five of your hero’s Ideals in a Storyline, your hero’s Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you unlock your Nova Power Words and can use those until the end of current Storyline.</p>
<p>When a new Storyline begins, all the marked off Ideals are cleared and it’s time to start again.</p>
<h4 id="random-ideals">Random Ideals</h4>
<p>If you’re stuck for ideas, you can roll roll two dice and check the following table – or just pick up to five from the list that sound good.</p>

<h3 id="toc-chargen-identity">Your Hero’s Identity</h3>
<p>“Identity” is a general term, and you can define it however you like for your hero. It could include their racial or cultural identity, their sexual or gender identity, their physical appearance, their pronouns, their disabilities (if any), their age, or any-or-all of these.</p>
<p>In addition, you can decide if your hero is a normal human; a human changed through an experiment or magic; a strange visitor from another world; an artificial life form; a time-traveler; or anything else you can imagine.</p>
<p><em>Most</em> heroes will go by two names – one being their personal, non-superhero name and the other being their superhero code-name.</p>
<p>It’s up to you if everyone knows your hero by both names, or if one is a <em>Secret Identity</em> only shared with a few.</p>
<p>You can also decide if your hero has the same general characteristics in all identities, or if they change from identity to the next: are they taller or shorter in their secret ID? Do they have the same gender in each identity?</p>
<p>Use your imagination, and don’t be afraid to bounce ideas off your fellow players and the Editor if you get stuck.</p>
<h3 id="toc-storyline">Initial Storyline</h3>
<p>A <strong>Storyline</strong> is one or more connected Issues focusing on one hero, known as the <strong>Spotlight</strong> hero. At a climactic part of the Storyline, the Spotlight hero has an <strong>Opportunity</strong> to change – the chance to evaluate their assumptions and decisions, and react accordingly.</p>
<p>Once in each Volume, your hero gets to play through one Storyline where they have the Spotlight. You get to define what their <em>Opportunity</em> will be – it could be an important lesson they get to learn, or a piece of information about their origin they’d never known, or an experience you think will force them to make a difficult moral decision.</p>
<p>There are five rules for creating an Opportunity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Your Hero is the <em>Star</em></strong> - An Opportunity can’t be focused on a group decision or a side character’s experiences, except for how that affects your hero.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You <em>Want</em> to Play Through It</strong> - The Editor will plan Crises based on the assumption that if you ask for an Opportunity, it represents something you actually want to have happen to your hero in the game. If you <em>aren’t</em> interested in it, then don’t ask for it!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change is Never <em>Easy</em></strong> - This means that you should expect that any Opportunity you create represents something that your hero can’t just easily dismiss or shrug off. If you say you want an Opportunity of being asked to join a villain team, then that should represent an actual struggle for your hero.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change is <em>Not</em> Required</strong> - An Opportunity is just that: the <em>chance</em> for a change. But it’s completely valid for your hero to come to that Opportunity and decide they <em>aren’t</em> going to change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Play to Find Out</strong> - Don’t pick the outcome, just the Opportunity! In other words, <em>don’t</em> come up with both the Opportunity <em>and</em> the result of the Storyline; be open to seeing where the questions will take your hero and let yourself be surprised through the act of playing the game.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When you create your hero, choose one Opportunity based on these five rules; you can ask the Editor and your fellow players for advice as well.</p>
<p>At the end of any Storyline where your hero is <em>not</em> the Spotlight hero, you have option of changing your Opportunity – for exmaple, if you come up with a better idea during another her’s Spotlight.</p>
<h4 id="opportunity-examples">Opportunity Examples</h4>
<p>These are examples of the types of Opportunities you can create.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Brigantia needs to learn that not everything can be solved by punching something.</li>
<li>I want Percival to cross swords with another Arthurian knight.</li>
<li>Kelly wants to confront poachers who harm sea animals.</li>
<li>I want Jack to get asked out by some villain dude.</li>
<li>The Sentinel of Saturn needs to let humans make their own mistakes.</li>
<li>I want Rockstar to be invited to join a new band.</li>
<li>Lin wants to fight one of their mother’s supervillains.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their civilian life – from their secret identity, their profession before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training.</p>
<div class="twocolumn skill-column-list">
<p>The Skills are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic</li>
<li>Artist</li>
<li>Criminal</li>
<li>Deputy</li>
<li>Engineer</li>
<li>Explorer</li>
<li>Hacker</li>

<li>Politician</li>
<li>Scientist</li>
<li>Socialite</li>
<li>Spy</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as determined by your class, which may also give additional skills.</p>
<h3 id="using-skills">Using Skills</h3>
<p>When you make a roll that could be affected by one of your Skills, you add a number of dice to the dice pool equal to the current Volume.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a Skill, you don’t add any extra dice to the pool.</p>
<h3 id="skill-descriptions">Skill Descriptions</h3>
<p>The skills in <span class="gamename"></span> are listed below, along with 3 to 5 suggestions how you could use the skill with your hero’s Approaches and consequences the Editor can propose on an Edge Success.</p>
<div class="skill-list">
<dl>
<dt>Academic</dt>
<dd><p>You’ve spent many years in education, either as an instructor or just a long-time student – or both! – you can decide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll <strong>Action/Academic</strong> to dispute widely accepted facts.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Detective/Academic</strong> to research facts in a library.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Mystery/Academic</strong> to falsify school records.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Suspense/Academic</strong> to spot plagiarism.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Success:</strong> Someone in your department develops an intense jealousy of you. Online trolls try to get you fired from your job. You spend way too much time on a relatively trivial matter.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Artist</dt>
<dd><p>You are skilled at creating works of art; choose one or more media in which you primarily work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll <strong>Action/Artist</strong> to make a bold splash in the art world.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Mystery/Artist</strong> to plant secret messages in a work of art.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Suspense/Artist</strong> to detect a forgery.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Success:</strong> You’re just not satisfied with this piece. Someone will start selling knockoff of your work online. A critic savages your work in a review.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Criminal</dt>
<dd><p>You’re skilled at evading the law and getting away with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll <strong>Adventure/Criminal</strong> to crack a safe.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Detective/Criminal</strong> to plan a heist.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Mystery/Criminal</strong> to steal something, unseen.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Suspense/Criminal</strong> to notice hidden cameras.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Success:</strong> Your crime makes more noise than you had hoped. A criminal organization takes an interest in your actions. You owe a favor to someone dodgy now.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="soapbox small">
<p>Keep in mind that <span class="gamename"></span> is a four-color game, not a simulation of reality – so Skills follow “comic book logic” rather than working as they really <em>should</em> in real life.</p>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Deputy</dt>
<dd><p>You are a police officer of some kind. If you like, you can be currently deputized by a local or federal agency. All cats are beautiful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll <strong>Action/Deputy</strong> to shake down an informant.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Adventure/Deputy</strong> to chase down an innocent person who is fleeing from you.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Detective/Deputy</strong> to contrive a reason to arrest someone.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Mystery/Deputy</strong> to plant contraband on a suspect.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Suspense/Deputy</strong> to spot a “likely” suspect for a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Success:</strong> Your actions are filmed by bystanders. The suspect can afford a lawyer. Your “evidence” won’t stand up in court.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Engineer</dt>
<dd><p>You can build high-tech devices. This is the four-color version of Engineering, not real-world engineering. You can choose one or more optional specialties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll <strong>Adventure/Engineer</strong> to build something unprecedented.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Detective/Engineer</strong> to dismantle something.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>Suspense/Engineer</strong> to identify the weaknesses in a design.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Success:</strong> You only have time to make one. You use up the last of your unobtanium on this device. Only you understand how to make this work.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Explorer</dt>

<div id="class-divine" class="classdata">
<h3 class="class" id="toc-divine">The Divine</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bright Mother Brigit, guide my hand!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are imbued with power that originates with one or more deities, or at least powerful extra-planar beings who could be worshipped as gods.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-divine">Playing a Divine</h4>
<p>As a Divine hero, you have a wide range of abilities to choose from. Look for ways you can find synergy with other heroes – if they join in a Power Combo that you initiate, your <em>Give Me Strength!</em> bonus applies to the dice they provide, too.</p>
<h4 id="questions">Questions</h4>
<p>As you create your Divine hero, answer any or all of these questions.</p>
<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>Are you a deity yourself?
<ul>
<li>A demigod?</li>
<li>The champion of one or more deities?</li>
<li>Or even someone who figuratively or literally stole power from the gods?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What god, gods or pantheon are you associated with?
<ul>
<li>Do you gain power from your association with a single deity, or do multiple gods grant you power?</li>
<li>Are your powers bestowed by the gods, or are they a result of your own divine essence?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do you relate to the god(s) who empower you?
<ul>
<li>Are you on good terms with them, are they distant and silent, or have they sent you to a mortal existence for your own good?</li>
<li>Are there other gods or other people empowered by the gods, and if so, do you get along with them?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are there any mythological monsters or enemies that your choice of a divine power source implies?</li>
<li>Do you have a single form and identity, or do you change through supernatural means between your Divine form and a “mortal” one?
<ul>
<li>If so, what triggers such a change – a spoken word, a transformation sequence, or just calling upon your Divine powers?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you’re not a mortal yourself, what <em>do</em> you think of the mortal world?
<ul>
<li>Does it mystify you, or are you thoroughly immersed in modern culture?</li>
<li>What are your views on religion – both your hero’s own religion and those that could be seen as rival faiths?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="skills">Skills</h4>
<p>You have the <strong>Explorer</strong>, <strong>Historian</strong>, and <strong>Mystic</strong> skills, plus two additional skills of your choice.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of dice equal to the Volume.</p>
<h4 id="class-ability-give-me-strength">Class Ability: Give Me Strength!</h4>
<p>When you use your Core Power Words or Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt or Power Combo, you can count 6s as two successes instead of 1. When you do, lose either 1 Health or 1 Might after your roll, regardless of how many extra successes you gained.</p>
<section id="real-world-religions" class="soapbox">
<h4>Real-World Religions?</h4>
<p>It’s a staple of superhero comic books that real-life deities are portrayed as either heroes themselves or the sources of power for a hero.</p>
<p>There’s an assumption that these “aren’t <em>real</em> gods who are sacred to anyone any more” – but that’s not necessarily true at all. For example, many modern pagans revere one or more of the Norse gods of myth.</p>
<p>You should be careful when you use mythological deities, <em>especially</em> those from a culture that’s foreign to you. Check with the other players and the Editor, and be prepared to change either your Divine hero or the concept behind them.</p>
</section>
<h4 id="power-words">Power Words</h4>
<p>You can use your Power Words in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a <strong>Power Display</strong>, costing no Might</li>

<li>As a <strong>Power Combo</strong>, costing 1 Might and letting others join in</li>
<li>Joining a <strong>Power Combo</strong>, costing 1 Might.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of the next Hero Phase.</p>
<h5 id="core-power-words">Core Power Words</h5>
<p>Your Core Power Words are <strong>Blessed</strong> and <strong>Champion</strong>. You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo, or 2 Might to add both.</p>
<h5 id="personal-power-words">Personal Power Words</h5>
<p>Choose six Personal Power Words from the following list:</p>
<div class="cpw">
<ul>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Armor</li>

<li>Extraplanar</li>

<h4 id="playing-a-dynamo">Playing a Dynamo</h4>
<p>This makes you especially good at blowing things up; in fights, you use up Might quickly, but regain it almost as quickly. Dynamo is one of the few classes that gets a third Core Power Word, so use that to increase your dice pools by spending Might freely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most other heroes – with the exception of some Inventors – have superhuman powers and abilities. You’re not like them. Your own training and talents are what made you what you are; you may have powers, you may have high-tech devices, but ultimately it comes down to your skill against someone else’s.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-knight">Playing a Knight</h4>
<p>When you play your Knight hero, come up with ways to use your Power Words that reflect your normal abilities instead of any superpowers you possess. Other heroes – such as the Dynamo or the Paragon – focus on their powers, but you rely on your Skills, your specialized tools, and your Fighting Styles.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> combine your Fighting Styles with each other and with your Power Words, so look for synergies there – nearly every Knight has a <em>Weapon</em> Power Word for that reason. If you pick <em>Weapon</em> (or <em>Vehicle</em>), name the general kind of weapon – Rifle, Boomerang, Sword, Shield, and so on.</p>
<p>If you’re going to play a more realistic hero, consider the <em>Weapons Locker</em> ability for access to weapon Power Words, and devote your own Personal Power Words to expanding the variety of effects you can produce.</p>

<h4>Cultural Sensitivity</h4>
<p>You can define any details you like about your Monarch’s home. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be aware of real-world stereotypes, bigotries, and privilege.</p>
<p>Your Monarch’s home is <em>never</em> somewhere that exists – or could exists – in the real world. You can live on the Moon, or in the Antarctic, or under the Pacific Ocean, or in an adjacent dimension, or on a floating city – but you can’t be the Monarch of China or Uganda or Pittsburgh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry, but I can’t let you do that.</p>

<p>You’re convinced that your powers are meant to help others, not for your own benefit. You protect those who can’t defend themselves, help those who can’t help themselves.</p>
<p>You’re the epitome of a hero. Flight, strength, invulnerability, and superhuman verions of normal human abilities are common among Paragons, along with the odd random power usually found in another class.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-paragon">Playing a Paragon</h4>
<p>If you’re playing a Paragon because you want to revel in your hero’s power … then you’re probably playing the wrong class.</p>
<p>Paragons, despite often being the most powerful heroes <em>in concept</em>, are primarily support heroes. The class ability – <em>My One Weakness!</em> – takes your hero out of the fight but gives a boost to the other heroes!</p>
<p>Your Paragon may have more Health than other heroes – but that’s because, ideally, you’re using Take the Hit whenever you possibly can. Paragons are about protecting others first, and punching villains a distant second.</p>
<p>Also, look for creative ways to use your <em>Powers</em> and <em>Abilities</em> Core Power Words – they can justify any number of ad hoc power uses in combination with your other Power Words, such as <em>Vision Powers</em> or <em>Alien Abilities</em>. What do those mean? Whatever you say they mean!</p>

<li>Who taught you that you have a responsibility to others?</li>
<li>Do you ever adopt a disguise to pass as a normal human?<br />

<h3 class="breakbefore class" id="toc-psychic">The Psychic</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I know secrets about you that you don’t even know yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psychics are masters of mind powers, able to communicate with others and link minds together.</p>
<p>Their powers are often purely mental without a physical manifestation; a duel between two Psychics could take place in the middle of a crowded restaurant with no one any the wiser.</p>
<p>If normal people knew that a Psychic was among them – and could potentially access their innermost thoughts and desires! – they would react with fear and hostility. Some Psychics will pose as some other type of hero to avoid such prejudices … even as they admit such biases might not be entirely unwarranted.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-psychic">Playing a Psychic</h4>
<p>Your Psychic hero is likely the lynchpin of the team, although not necessarily the leader. This is a passive ability, though – unless you choose otherwise, everyone’s connected when you’re present – so look for ways to use your Power Words, Skills, and Abilities.</p>
<section id="no-ethical-mind-control-under-capitalism" class="soapbox">
<h4>No Ethical Mind Control Under Capitalism</h4>
<p>Many comic books and roleplaying games will gloss over it, but I’ll state it directly: nearly any use of mind control powers represents gross violations of another person’s autonomy and consent.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you can’t <em>ever</em> do that in an Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, but it means that you have to be careful and safe by checking in with the other players and the Editor – because your Psychic hero is probably doing something that’s quite horrific if you’re using mind control.</p>
<p>During Issue 0 or the start of an Issue, you should ask the other players and the Editor about whether they view reading someone’s mind without consent as the same kind of violation. Are surface thoughts fine, but deep memories not? You <em>need</em> to have these kinds of talks, as a group, before it comes up in play.</p>

<ul>
<li>What kind of training or education did you undertake to master them?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are there obvious signs to your powers, such as an enlarged forehead, glowing eyes, or a visible crackle of power – or are they completely invisible and undetectable?</li>
<li>What limits have you imposed on your own power due to ethical and moral concerns?
<ul>
<li>What type of actions won’t you take, and what would push you to actually commit those acts?</li>
<li>What makes you a <em>hero</em> and not a mind-powered villain, looting others’ skulls with impunity?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What kind of mental self-image do you have?
<ul>

<h3 class="breakbefore class" id="toc-shaper">The Shaper</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone wave goodbye to him! Get it? Wave. Because I control waves. Nobody? Tough crowd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Shaper is able to control some physical – or quasi-physical – substance, such as rock, water, or shadows. Their powers have a greater effect on the world around them than most heroes’ do, such as controlling the weather or leveling buildings with a glance.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-shaper">Playing a Shaper</h4>
<p>Your Shaper hero focuses on two things: the type of matter you can control, and the environment around you.</p>
<p>Each scene has several Scene Power Words that are chosen by the Editor during the Countdown to Crisis. However, an Editor might not think of everything – so it’s fine for you to suggest that perhaps there might be a magazine stand on the street corner, for example, if your hero controls paper.</p>
<p>One of the first things you’re going to want to do is use your <em>Reshape the Battlefield</em> ability to give yourself and the other heroes Scene Power Words to use. Remember that a Scene Power Word costs 0 Might to use! Reshaping at the start of a Crisis can save you a <em>lot</em> of Might in the long run!</p>
<section id="other-element-power-words" class="soapbox">
<h4>Other Element Power Words</h4>
<p>If you can think of something else you’d like your Shaper hero to control, then choose that as your Element Power Word instead! If you decide that your hero controls dairy products, then go for it! If you need advice on a good Word to pick, you can always ask the Editor and other players for ideas.</p>
</section>

<ul>
<li>If you lost control, would you shut down or would you lash out?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can you generate your own element, or are you reliant upon having your element present to start shaping?</li>
<li>Do you view yourself as speaking to nature and asking for its aid, or as forcing the elements to bend to your will, or as an artist carefully sculpting exactly what you need from the world?</li>
<li>What effect does your emotional state have on the environment?
<ul>
<li>How does the state of your environment affect <em>you</em>?</li>
