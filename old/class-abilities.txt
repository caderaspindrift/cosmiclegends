**Give Me Strength!**
> 
> When you use your Core Power Words or Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt 
> or Power Combo, you can count 6s as two successes instead of 1. 
> When you do, lose either 1 Health or 1 Might after your roll for each
> extra success.
 
**Energy Reserve**
> 
> You're overflowing with energy. If you start the Hero Turn with less
> than two Might points, you regain 1 Might.
 
**No Wasted Effort**
> 
> When you make a roll to advance a Goal, you can choose to
> add some or all of the roll's Effectiveness to the Teamwork
> Pool instead.
 
**Peak Human Potential**
> 
> You represent the pinnacle of human achievement. If you have
> any powers, they're minor in comparison to your extensive training.
> 
> This is reflected in both your large number of skills and your
> combat prowess: 
> 
> Choose one additional Fighting Style.
 
**The Price of Magic**
> 
> When you use one of your Core Power Words or Nova Power Words as a third 
> Word in a Power Stunt or Power Test, count 2s as Edge Successes in addition
> to 1s.
 
**For My Kingdom!**
> 
> You feel a special attachment to your homeland, whether it be
> a physical location or a metaphorical concept such as "the Seas".
> 
> If you declare that a Crisis threatens your domain, add 3 to the
> Teamwork Pool when you form it, and add 1 additional point to the
> Pool when you add to it during the Crisis.
 
**Engine of Destruction**
> 
> When you use your Core Power Words or Nova Power Words as
> the third Word in a Power Stunt or Power Combo, add 2 to
> a Smash roll's Effectiveness.
 
**My One Weakness!**
> 
> When you create your hero, pick a weakness they possess --
> usually some kind of substance, energy type, or other physical
> phenomenon.
> 
> During a Crisis, you can declare at any point that your one 
> weakness is present.  
> 
> If you do, you temporarily lose access to *all* of your Power Words, 
> your Might becomes 0,
> and you skip your turn during the Hero Turn. This lasts until someone
> else removes the source of your weakness from the scene, or until 
> the end of the present Crisis.
> 
> Every Hero Turn that you're inactive, the other heroes get extra
> dice on their rolls equal to the Volume number.
> 
> When the source of your weakness is disposed of, you regain access
> to all your Power Words and your Might is refreshed to its normal
> maximum value.

**Our Minds As One**
> 
> As long as you are conscious, you and the other heroes can communicate with each
> other telepathically.
> 
> If everyone in a Power Combo is part of your Mind Link, the hero making the
> roll adds 2 extra dice to the roll.

**Reshape the Battlefield**
> 
> As your move during the Hero Phase of a Crisis, you can
> change your environment. 
> 
> Choose your Power Words, spend Might as normal, and make a 
> roll. 
> 
> If the Effectiveness of your roll is at least 1, you can change 
> one of the Scene Power Words to one of your own Power Words until 
> the end of the Crisis.  
> 
> The maximum number of Scene Power Words you can change during a
> Crisis is equal to the current Volume number.
