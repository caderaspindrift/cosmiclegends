**History:**

Martin McCord never wanted to become the world's first
One-Officer-Police-Force, but a near-fatal shootout took
that choice away from him. Seconds away from dying, his injured
brain was transplanted into the ADAM-42 android body, saving
his life and trapping him in a metal form physically superior
to, and distinctively less functional than, his original human body.
Officially, McCord is dead -- but with the right prosthetic mask,
he can pass among humans as Adam Lii, the newest recruit of the
Los Angeles Police Department.
