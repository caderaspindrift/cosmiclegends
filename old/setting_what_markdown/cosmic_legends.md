The Cosmic Legends of the Universe were founded in September 1963 by 
Titan, the Sentinel of Saturn;
Sir Percival, the Grailknight;
Miss Magister: Maddie Dee;
Sequana, Champion of the Tuatha Dé Danann;
Vespa (I); 
and the Falconer.
They came together to fight against the invasion of Earth by 
Fomorians under the control
of Xana Mega, faerie queen of the 
Aos Sí.

Although their membership has changed over the decades, they remain
committed to protecting the Earth from the forces of evil.
