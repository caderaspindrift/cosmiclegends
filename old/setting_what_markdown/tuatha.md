The *Fir Domnann* people -- collectively known as the 
Tuatha Dé Danann --
are powerful extradimensional entities once worshipped as gods by the 
Celts. They grant a portion of their power to a mortal human who becomes
their Champion; the current Champion is Sienna MacGowan, otherwise 
known as Brigantia of the Cosmic Legends.

## Apology to Celtic Pagans

I apologize in advance for the horrible mishandling of the 
Tuatha Dé Danann and other elements of Celtic mythology.
It's done specifically in reference to the way Marvel Comics
handled the Norse, Greek, and other pantheons over the years.
