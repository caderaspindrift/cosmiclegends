    "Selena Brown was an orphan girl who lived on a 
    farm and had a great fear of the moon. One night, 
    while cleaning the attic, she came upon a magic 
    Moon-Jewel necklace which gave her incredible 
    strength. She uses this gift in a variety of ways 
    that catch the attention of the media and Moon Girl.

    Eventually, she wound up saving two hardened 
    criminals from a possibly fatal accident. Seeing how 
    useful she could be to them, they force her to help 
    them break into a bank by threatening to kill her 
    foster parents if she refuses. She complies.

    When Moon Girl intervenes, the thieves shove Selena 
    into the bank vault, where she starts suffocating. 
    She is eventually rescued by Moon Girl, who is 
    revealed to be her cousin. (Selena's mother, also 
    named Selena, was Moon Girl's aunt.)

    Given the secret identity of \"the Starlet,\" she 
    joins Moon Girl as her sidekick."
