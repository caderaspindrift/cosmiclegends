# The Expert {#toc-expert .breakbefore .class}

> Actually, most people don't know this, but ...

Like the Knight and Inventor, you aren't a hero who relies on your
super-powers. Instead, you're very skilled at one specific thing --
and there are few in the world who can match your expertise in your chosen field.

## Playing an Expert

Don't be afraid to use your Engineer, Hacker, Scientist, or
other skills in conjunction with your Power Words to represent
making on-the-fly adjustments to whatever gear you carry.

## Questions

As you create your Expert hero, answer any or all of these questions.

:::::::::: questions ::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Skills

Choose any one skill as your **Prime Skill**. Whenever you use that
skill in a roll, double the number of dice you get from being skilled;
i.e., from 1 to 2.

Alternately, you can choose a **Prime Fighting Style** instead of a
**Prime Skill**. Whenever you use that Fighting Style, double the number
of dice granted by it; for example, if you chose Brawler, which says *Add 2 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal*, you would instead add 4 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal.

In addition, choose any two additional skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of 
dice equal to the Volume.

## Power Words

You can use your Power Words in the following ways:

- As a **Power Display**, costing no Might
- As a **Power Stunt**, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first
- As a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might and letting others join in
- Joining a **Power Combo**, costing 1 Might.

When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of
the next Hero Phase.

### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Renowned** and **Expert**.

When you use a **Power Display,** you can add one Core Power Word for free.

You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo,
or 2 Might to add both.

### Personal Power Words

Unlike other heroes, you don't have any Personal Power Words.

### Nova Power

Unlike other heroes, you don't have Nova Power Words. When you have
marked all of your Ideals, you gain the standard Might refresh, 
but don't unlock any additional Nova Power Words.

## Expert Abilities {.class}

Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class.
Your Expert Abilities reflect growing expertise in your primary field
and a number of related fields.  Each ability can be chosen only once.

### Prime Ability

Your hero has the **World-Renowned Expertise** Prime ability common 
to all Experts.

:::::: {.ability-list .prime }::::::::::
World-Renowned Expertise

:   When you chose your skills, you picked one as your
    Prime Skill. Whenever you use that skill in a roll,
    add 3 dice instead of 1 die.

    If you chose a Prime Fighting Style instead of a Prime Skill,
    triple the number of dice that Fighting Style provides.
