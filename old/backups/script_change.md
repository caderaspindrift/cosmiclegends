# Script Change

The **Script Change RPG Toolbox** is a collection
of tools that can be used to adjust play and
content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the
video conference software or virtual tabletop you
are using, or using hand signals. Before the game
begins, remind your players that they are available
and how to use them.

[Rewind]{.icon .rewind} can be used when something
has happened in play that makes a participant
uncomfortable. When [Rewind]{.icon .rewind} is used by
tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to rewind...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a
point before it happened, and play starts again.

[Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} can be used when a
participant would like to skip past uncomfortable
content or to the next part of the story for pacing.
When [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to fast forward...”), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

[Pause]{.icon .pause} can be used when things are too
intense, but you still want to continue playing the
scene. When [Pause]{.icon .pause} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to pause...”), you can take a break
and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
[Pause]{.icon .pause}, you can [Resume]{.icon .resume}, 
[Rewind]{.icon .rewind}, [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff}.

[Resume]{.icon .resume} can be used when everyone is ready
to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing
content. When [Resume]{.icon .resume} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“Let’s resume...”), continue with play.
