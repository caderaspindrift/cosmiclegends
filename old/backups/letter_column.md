# The Letter Column

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the session and communicate 
feedback in a positive and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed and loved 
about the game. This could include a particular moment of roleplay, 
a Crisis created by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular interactions 
between heroes, potential story moments and development, or 
anything else that could make the game even better in the future.
