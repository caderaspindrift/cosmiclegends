# What are safety tools?

Sometimes games have content or situations
where a player or Editor may feel stressed out,
unsafe, or otherwise not having fun. Safety tools
are a way for players and Editors to communicate
and check-in before, during, and after a game in
order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and
to provide the right support when needed.

Communication, trust, and care
The key to safety tools is communication and
trust. There needs to be open and respectful
communication alongside a culture of trust for
these to work.

As an Editor, player, or organizer, you can create
this culture by making it clear that the care and
well-being of everyone at the table comes before
the game or story. This can be done by actively
listening to everyone, offering accomodations and
safety tools, implementing actions when asked
while not prying (nobody owes you their trauma
as explanation), and actively checking in before,
during, and after a game.

## Before the Game Begins

[]{.lorem}

### Session 0

Session 0s are a great way to begin
communication, set expectations on the kind of
story and play, and introduce and discuss what
safety tools will be used at the table.

### Lines and Veils

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries
on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on
content, things that the Editor or the players don’t
want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are
soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means
that the content might be in the game but not
spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the
game.

### Script Change Rating

**Script Change** ratings are used to set tone and
boundaries for your game. Using film ratings (or
your own), you can outline what audience you’re
playing for (e.g. PG-13 vs R). 

The **rating** also
addresses what content players do want to see
as well as what they don’t want to see. Make sure
to balance and respect everyone’s do and don’t
wants. 

**Ratings** and do-and-don’t-want content can
be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

## During the Game

### X, N, and O Cards

**X**, **N**, and **O cards** are check-in tools. They can be
used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in
the chat function of the video conference software
or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand
signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone
that they are available and how to use them.

The **X card** can be used at any point if a
participant is uncomfortable with the content
happening in-game. When the **X card** is used by
tapping the card or typing an **“X”** in the chat, the
group can change, rewind, or skip the content.

The **N card** can be used at any point if a participant
feels like they are headed towards an X. When the
**N card** is used by tapping the card or typing an
**“N”** in the chat, the group can change the content
or have the scene “fade to black.”

The **O card** can be used at any point if a
participant wants to continue with the content.
When the **O card** is used by tapping the card
or typing an **“O”** in the chat, the group is ok to
continue with the content. They can also regularly
be prompted by a **“O?”** asked out loud or in the
chat to check-in if everyone is still ok.

## Script Change

The **Script Change RPG Toolbox** is a collection
of tools that can be used to adjust play and
content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the
video conference software or virtual tabletop you
are using, or using hand signals. Before the game
begins, remind your players that they are available
and how to use them.

[Rewind]{.icon .rewind} can be used when something
has happened in play that makes a participant
uncomfortable. When [Rewind]{.icon .rewind} is used by
tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to rewind...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a
point before it happened, and play starts again.

[Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} can be used when a
participant would like to skip past uncomfortable
content or to the next part of the story for pacing.
When [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to fast forward...”), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

[Pause]{.icon .pause} can be used when things are too
intense, but you still want to continue playing the
scene. When [Pause]{.icon .pause} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to pause...”), you can take a break
and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
[Pause]{.icon .pause}, you can [Resume]{.icon .resume}, 
[Rewind]{.icon .rewind}, [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff}.

[Resume]{.icon .resume} can be used when everyone is ready
to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing
content. When [Resume]{.icon .resume} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“Let’s resume...”), continue with play.

### Open Door

The **Open Door** is the assurance that someone
can leave or take a break from the game for their
own safety and well-being without being judged.
State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

### Breaks

For games longer than 2 hours or games that have
intense content, having a short built-in break is
recommended to allow people to stay focused and
process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any
other needs during this time.

## After the Game

[]{.lorem}

### Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over
into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment
of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships
between players and Editor if not worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game
begins and ends, and being conscious of which
feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

### Stars and Wishes

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the
session and communicate feedback in a positive
and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed
and loved about the game. This could include a
particular moment of roleplay, a Crisis created
by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular
interactions between heroes, potential story
moments and development, or anything else that
could make the game even better in the future.

### Highlight Reel and Wrap Session

Similar to **stars and wishes**, Script Change
has **Highlight Reel** and **Wrap Session**. 

The **Highlight Reel** is used to reflect on the session
and highlight moments participants enjoyed. At
the end of the game, go around and get everyone
to state highlight of the game for them. This
could include a particular moment of roleplay,
Crisi created by the Editor, or anything else
that stuck out as something awesome during the
game. 

The **Wrap Session** is an opportunity for the
group to reflect on the session and discuss what
could be improved going forward. At the end of the
game, go around and open up discussion about
the game. This could include content participants
didn’t feel comfortable calling pause or rewind at
the time, or talking about emotional impacts and bleed.

There should be no social pressure to disclose
the details or trauma to justify why someone felt
uncomfortable or unsafe during the game, as long
as the discussion moves towards how to address
the issues going forward.
