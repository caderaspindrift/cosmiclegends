# The Ages of Comics

The Modern Age - ca. 1985 to present

:   The start current age of comics is usually dated to the 
    *Crisis on Infinite Earths* and *Secret Wars* 12-issue series
    published by DC Comics and Marvel Comics, respectively.

    Darker, mature themes were explored in titles like the 
    *Teen Titans* and *X-Men*, while heroes such as Superman 
    had their backstories revamped for a contemporary setting. 
    Antiheroes such as the Punisher flourished in the modern age.

    The CCA also withered away to nothing as the major publishers
    increasingly created comics without the CCA seal on the cover.
