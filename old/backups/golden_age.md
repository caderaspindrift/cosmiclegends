# The Ages of Comics

American comics fans and scholars divide the history of U.S.
comics into four loosely defined "ages": the Golden Age, the
Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Modern Age.

The Golden Age - 1938 to 1956

:   The Golden Age started with the introduction of Superman,
    and the creation of the superhero model that's been used for years. 
    Many of the most well-known characters, such as Wonder Woman 
    and Captain America, were created during the Golden Age.
  
    Some comics in the Golden Age were just simplistic fun, while
    others feature dark themes, shocking gore, and vile villains.
    There was a lot of punching Nazis back in those days.
    Punching Nazis is always a good thing. 
  
    Unfortunately, racism and sexism often were major themes in Golden 
    Age comics; examples of anti-Asian hatred are all too easy to find.
