# Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over
into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment
of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships
between players and Editor if not worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game
begins and ends, and being conscious of which
feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.
