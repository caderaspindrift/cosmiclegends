# The Ages of Comics

The Silver Age - 1956 to circa 1970

:   The Silver Age began when DC Comics
    created new versions of the Flash, Green Lantern, and others,
    then the Justice League of America. Marvel responded by
    creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Avengers,
    and the Hulk.
  
    "Radiation" was everywhere -- not the type that gives you cancer,
    but that magical sort of radiation that blasted hapless individuals
    and turned them into monsters, heroes, or both.
  
    Another feature of the Silver Age was the Comics Code Authority,
    a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic
    over the content of comics.
  
    Mainstream comics in the Silver Age followed a long list of 
    restrictions that banned everything from "horror" and "gore" 
    to "vampires" and "cannibalism".  Heroes always won, villains 
    always got what was comin' to 'em, and authority figures were 
    respected -- at least, that's what the Comics Code demanded.
