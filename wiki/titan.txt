of the primary leaders among the heroes.

== History ==

Ty'Tonn To'Rezz's story begins on [[Jarnsaxa|Jarnsaxa]], one of the smaller, outer moons
of [[Saturn|Saturn]]. There, Ty'Tonn and his spouses manned the massive telescopes and
monitoring systems created by the [[Sentinels of Saturn|Sentinels of Saturn]].

When the remote sensory devices detected the approach of a [[Visitor|Visitor]] fleet,
Ty'Tonn was chosen to travel to *[[L'Shar'Ak|L'Shar'Ak]]*, capital of [[Titan|Titan]], and present 
their findings to *[[Sentinels of Saturn|Kyl'Sh'Tal]]* command.

According to the course computed by [[My'Tonn To'Rezz|My'Tonn]], Ty's sibling, the Visitors would
pass by just the outermost moons of Saturn and instead were on a direct path
for *W'Ty'Dah'k*, the third planet from the sun: [[Earth]].

Fearing the harm the Visitors could do to the primitive, just-barely-nuclear
civilizations of *W'Ty'Dah'k*, Ty'Tonn urged the *Kyl'Sh'Tal* to intervene.
"Are we not the Sentinels for the entire solar system?", Ty argued; "Should we
not be concerned with the fate of all who are threatened by the Visitors?"

The *Kyl'Sh'Tal* council debated for many hours but it soon became clear that
they prioritized the survival of Titanian civilization over that of  *[[Earth|W'Ty'Dah'k]]* --
and even considered the potentially massive loss of human
life to a net benefit to the [[Titanians|people of Titan]].

Outraged by their actions, Ty'Tonn returned to Jarnsaxa and plotted sedition
within in their spousal cluster. Ty' would head to *W'Ty'Dah'k* first, to be
followed by the rest of the cluster once contact had been established with the
Earthings.

Ty'Tonn To'Rezz arrived on Earth in [[October 1956|October]] [[1956|1956]] and made contact with 
the Americans' [[A.L.E.R.T.|Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats (A.L.E.R.T.)]].
Becoming known on Earth as *Titan*, Ty'Tonn worked with A.L.E.R.T., [[Marquis Malign|Marquis Malign]],
[[Vespa I|Vespa]] and [[Obsidius Rex|Obsidius]] to drive back the initial wave of Visitor landing craft
and break their [[Third Visitation|invasion]].

Scorned by the other *[[Sentinels of Saturn|Kyl'Sh'Tal]]* for disobedience, Ty'Tonn To'Rezz returned to 
their family on Jarnsaxa, only to find that the monitoring outpost had been 
destroyed by retreating Visitor craft when the station's cloaking screens 
failed under mysterious circumstances.

Following that tragedy, Ty'Tonn relocated permanently to the planet Earth,
despite the sweltering heat, and went on to help found the [[Cosmic Legends of the Universe|Cosmic Legends of the Universe]]
in [[September 1963|September]] [[1963|1963]]. For while he used the name "[[Tom Torres|Tom Torres]]" but has
since discontinued the use of an alternate identity. Since the start of the 21
century, he has lived in [[Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]] and has been granted honorary Canadian
citizenship.
