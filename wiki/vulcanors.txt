'''Vulcanors''', also known as ''Homo sapiens vulcanis'', 
are an offshoot of [[clu:Human|humanity]] that was
experimented on by the [[clu:Visitors|]] over 3,000 years ago; their
skin was hardened to a shiny gloss and they were adapted to
live in volcanic conditions. Slaying their Visitor enslavers
and stealing a shuttle craft, they settled on an otherwise
uninhabitable [[clu:Vulcanor_(archipelago)|remote chain of islands]] in the [[:w:South_Pacific|south Pacific]].

That distance allowed the Vulcanors time to disassemble and
reverse-engineer many Visitor technologies, including a
[[clu:Vulcanor_(archipelago)#Magnetic-field|compass-scrambling magnetic field]] that cloaked their islands
from the [[:w:Timeline_of_European_imperialism|European colonialist powers]].

With the arrival of [[clu:Titan|]] on Earth in [[clu:1956|]], King [[clu:Tachylus Rex|Tachylus]]
decreed it was time to join the rest of the world and share --
in limited amounts -- their unique technologies. His son
[[clu:Obsidius Rex|Obsidius]] was sent as an emissary and later joined the
[[clu:Cosmic Legends of the Universe|]].

Excessive heat and volcanic gasses prevent the Vulcanor 
Islands from becoming a vacation destination. While outsiders
are welcomed and treated with respect, few non-Vulcanors have 
been to [[clu:Volcano City|]].
