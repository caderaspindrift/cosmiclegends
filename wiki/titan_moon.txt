Titan is one of seven [[:w:List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System|gravitationally rounded]] moons in orbit around [[clu:Saturn|Saturn]], and the second most distant from Saturn of those seven. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger (in diameter) than Earth's [[:w:Moon|Moon]] and 80% more massive. It is the [[:w:List of natural satellites by diameter|second-largest moon]] in the [[clu:Solar System|Solar System]] after Jupiter's moon [[:w:Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and is larger than the planet [[:w:Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], but only 40% as [[:w:mass|mass]]ive.

Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer [[:w:Christiaan Huygens|Christiaan Huygens]], Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four [[:w:Galilean moons|Galilean moons of Jupiter]]). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees, and if it were visible through the moon's thick atmosphere, it would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.

Titan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material, which is likely differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice, including a crust of [[:w:ice Ih|ice I<sub>h</sub>]] and a subsurface layer of ammonia-rich liquid water.<ref>{{cite book |title=Titan from Cassini-Huygens |url=https://archive.org/details/titanfromcassini00brow |url-access=limited |editor=Robert Brown |editor2=Jean Pierre Lebreton |editor3=Hunter Waite |publisher= Springer Science & Business Media |year=2009 |page=[https://archive.org/details/titanfromcassini00brow/page/n73 69] |isbn=9781402092152}}</ref> Much as with [[:w:Venus|Venus]] before the [[:w:Space Age|Space Age]], the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until the ''[[:w:Cassini–Huygens]]'' mission in 2004 provided new information, including the discovery of [[:w:liquid hydrocarbon|liquid hydrocarbon]] lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few [[:w:impact crater|impact crater]]s, although mountains and several possible [[:w:cryovolcano|cryovolcano]]es have been found.

The atmosphere of Titan is largely [[:w:nitrogen|nitrogen]]; minor components lead to the formation of [[:w:methane|methane]] and [[:w:ethane|ethane]] clouds and heavy [[:w:Category:Organonitrogen compounds|organonitrogen haze]]. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan's methane cycle bears a striking similarity to Earth's [[:w:water cycle|water cycle]], albeit at the much lower temperature of about {{convert|94|K|°C F|abbr=}}.

Titan orbits Saturn once every 15 days 22 hours. Like Earth's [[:w:Moon|Moon]] and many of the satellites of the [[:w:giant planet|giant planet]]s, its [[:w:rotational period|rotational period]] (its day) is identical to its orbital period; Titan is [[:w:tidal locking|tidally locked]] in synchronous rotation with Saturn, and permanently shows one face to the planet.

==Formation==
The moons of Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through [[:w:Accretion disc|co-accretion]], a similar process to that believed to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn's system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn's system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter's [[:w:Galilean satellites|Galilean satellites]], but that they were disrupted by a series of [[giant impact]]s, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn's mid-sized moons, such as [[:w:Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] and [[:w:Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], were formed from the debris of these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan's orbital eccentricity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Giant impact scenario may explain the unusual moons of Saturn |work=Space Daily |date=2012 |url=https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Giant_impact_scenario_may_explain_the_unusual_moons_of_Saturn_999.html |access-date=October 19, 2012 |archive-date=March 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328232204/http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Giant_impact_scenario_may_explain_the_unusual_moons_of_Saturn_999.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Clouds typically cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened [[insolation|levels of sunlight]] during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in [[convection]]. This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Emily L. |first1=Schaller |last2=Brouwn |first2=Michael E. |last3=Roe |first3=Henry G. |last4=Bouchez |first4=Antonin H. |date=2006 |title=A large cloud outburst at Titan's south pole |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.12.021 |journal=Icarus |issue=1 |pages=224–229 |url=https://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/largecloud.pdf |volume=182 |bibcode=2006Icar..182..224S |access-date=August 23, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926102541/https://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/largecloud.pdf |archive-date=September 26, 2007  }}</ref> It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight.<ref name="Titan wind">{{cite news|title=The Way the Wind Blows on Titan |date=June 1, 2007 |url=https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cassinifeatures/feature20070601f/ |access-date=June 2, 2007 |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427110242/https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cassinifeatures/feature20070601f/ |archive-date=April 27, 2009 }}</ref> When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Huge ethane cloud discovered on Titan |last=Shiga |first=David |journal=New Scientist |volume=313 |page=1620 |date=2006 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10073-huge-ethane-cloud-discovered-on-titan.html |access-date=August 7, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220030748/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10073-huge-ethane-cloud-discovered-on-titan.html |archive-date=December 20, 2008  }}</ref>

The possibility of hydrocarbon seas on Titan was first suggested based on ''Voyager 1'' and ''2'' data that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere of approximately the correct temperature and composition to support them, but direct evidence was not obtained until 1995 when data from Hubble and other observations suggested the existence of [[liquid methane]] on Titan, either in disconnected pockets or on the scale of satellite-wide oceans, similar to water on Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dermott |first1=S.

On July 8, 2009, ''Cassini's'' VIMS observed a specular reflection indicative of a smooth, mirror-like surface, off what today is called [[Jingpo Lacus]], a lake in the north polar region shortly after the area emerged from 15 years of winter darkness. Specular reflections are indicative of a smooth, mirror-like surface, so the observation corroborated the inference of the presence of a large liquid body drawn from radar imaging.<ref name="press">{{cite web |last=Cook |first=J.-R.

In May 2013, ''Cassini'''s radar altimeter observed Titan's Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently filled with liquid. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are at the same level as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea but there are a few isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.<ref>Valerio Poggiali, Marco Mastrogiuseppe, Alexander G.

During six flybys of Titan from 2006 to 2011, ''Cassini'' gathered radiometric tracking and optical navigation data from which investigators could roughly infer Titan's changing shape. The density of Titan is consistent with a body that is about 60% rock and 40% water. The team's analyses suggest that Titan's surface can rise and fall by up to 10 metres during each orbit. That degree of warping suggests that Titan's interior is relatively deformable, and that the most likely model of Titan is one in which an icy shell dozens of kilometres thick floats atop a global ocean.<ref name="Tides">{{cite news |first=Sid |last=Perkins |title=Tides turn on Titan |date=June 28, 2012 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/tides-turn-on-titan-1.10917 |work=Nature |access-date=June 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007082709/https://www.nature.com/news/tides-turn-on-titan-1.10917 |archive-date=October 7, 2012  }}</ref> The team's findings, together with the results of previous studies, hint that Titan's ocean may lie no more than {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} below its surface.<ref name="Tides" /><ref name="Titan ocean of water">{{cite web |last=Puiu |first=Tibi |title=Saturn's moon Titan most likely harbors a subsurface ocean of water |work=zmescience.com web site |date=June 29, 2012 |url=https://www.zmescience.com/research/studies/titan-subsurface-ocean-of-water-23323/ |access-date=June 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903075517/https://www.zmescience.com/research/studies/titan-subsurface-ocean-of-water-23323/ |archive-date=September 3, 2012  }}</ref> On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be as salty as the [[Dead Sea]].<ref name="NASA-20140702">{{cite web |last1=Dyches |first1=Preston |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |title=Ocean on Saturn Moon Could be as Salty as the Dead Sea |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-217 |date=July 2, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |access-date=July 2, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709165628/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-217 |archive-date=July 9, 2014  }}</ref><ref name="ICARUS-2014">{{cite journal |last1=Mitri |first1=Giuseppe |last2=Meriggiola |first2=Rachele |last3=Hayes |first3=Alex |last4=Lefevree |first4=Axel |last5=Tobie | first5=Gabriel |last6=Genovad |first6=Antonio |last7=Lunine |first7=Jonathan I. |last8=Zebker |first8=Howard |title=Shape, topography, gravity anomalies and tidal deformation of Titan |date= 2014 |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.03.018 |volume=236 |pages=169–177 |bibcode = 2014Icar..236..169M }}</ref> On September 3, 2014, NASA reported studies suggesting [[methane]] rainfall on Titan may interact with a layer of icy materials underground, called an "alkanofer", to produce [[ethane]] and [[propane]] that may eventually feed into rivers and lakes.<ref name="NASA-20140903">{{cite web |last1=Dyches |first1=Preston |last2=Mousis |first2=Olivier |last3=Altobelli |first3=Nicolas |title=Icy Aquifers on Titan Transform Methane Rainfall |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-294 |date=September 3, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |access-date=September 4, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905000214/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-294 |archive-date=September 5, 2014  }}</ref>

In 2016, Cassini found the first evidence of fluid-filled channels on Titan, in a series of deep, steep-sided canyons flowing into [[Ligeia Mare]]. This network of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, range in depth from 240 to 570&nbsp;m and have sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting, like Earth's [[Grand Canyon]], or a lowering of sea level, or perhaps a combination of the two. The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long-term features that persist for thousands of years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cassini Finds Flooded Canyons on Titan|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2016-207|publisher=NASA|year=2016|access-date=August 12, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811140908/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2016-207|archive-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref>

Many of Titan's craters or probable craters display evidence of extensive erosion, and all show some indication of modification.<ref name="Wood2009" /> Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, despite the fact that some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of [[Palimpsest (planetary astronomy)|palimpsests]] through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons.<ref name="Wood2009" /> Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of [[Cryovolcano|cryovolcanic lava]]. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ivanov |first1=B. A. |last2=Basilevsky |first2=A.

The limited high-resolution radar coverage of Titan obtained through 2007 (22%) suggested the existence of nonuniformities in its crater distribution. [[Xanadu (Titan)|Xanadu]] has 2–9 times more craters than elsewhere. The leading hemisphere has a 30% higher density than the trailing hemisphere. There are lower crater densities in areas of equatorial dunes and in the north polar region (where hydrocarbon lakes and seas are most common).<ref name="Wood2009">{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=C.

Pre-''Cassini'' models of impact trajectories and angles suggest that where the impactor strikes the water ice crust, a small amount of ejecta remains as liquid water within the crater.

In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary geologist of [[Ames Research Center]]) proposed an alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, he asserted that Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, [[fluvial]] and [[Eolian processes|eolian]] erosion, [[mass wasting]] and other [[exogenic]] processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded [[Escarpment|scarps]] of large multi-ring impact structures or as a result of the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of {{convert|176|K|C}}, which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan ''Callisto with weather''.<ref name="Moore2008" /><ref name="Lakdawalla2008">{{cite web |last=Lakdawalla |first=Emily |author-link=Emily Lakdawalla |title=AGU: Titan: Volcanically active world, or "Callisto with weather? |url=https://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001775/ |access-date=October 11, 2010 |publisher=The Planetary Society |date=December 17, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618091010/https://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2008/1775.html |archive-date=June 18, 2013  }}</ref>

In March 2009, structures resembling lava flows were announced in a region of Titan called Hotei Arcus, which appears to fluctuate in brightness over several months. Though many phenomena were suggested to explain this fluctuation, the lava flows were found to rise {{convert|200|m|ft|sp=us}} above Titan's surface, consistent with it having been erupted from beneath the surface.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Giant 'ice flows' bolster case for Titan's volcanoes |last=Shiga |first=David |journal=New Scientist |date=March 28, 2009 }}</ref>

In December 2010, the ''Cassini'' mission team announced the most compelling possible cryovolcano yet found. Named [[Sotra Patera]], it is one in a chain of at least three mountains, each between 1000 and 1500&nbsp;m in height, several of which are topped by large craters. The ground around their bases appears to be overlaid by frozen lava flows.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturn Moon Has Ice Volcano—And Maybe Life? |first=Richard A. |last=Lovett |work=National Geographic |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101215-saturn-moon-titan-ice-volcano-nasa-science-pictures/ |date=2010 |access-date=December 19, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019073955/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101215-saturn-moon-titan-ice-volcano-nasa-science-pictures/ |archive-date=October 19, 2012  }}</ref>

Some of these features appear quite fresh, suggesting that such volcanic activity continues to the present.<ref name="Wood2020" />

Most of Titan's highest peaks occur near its equator in so-called "ridge belts". They are believed to be analogous to Earth's [[fold mountains]] such as the [[Rockies]] or the [[Himalayas]], formed by the collision and buckling of tectonic plates, or to [[subduction zones]] like the [[Andes]], where upwelling lava (or [[cryolava]]) from a melting descending plate rises to the surface. One possible mechanism for their formation is tidal forces from Saturn. Because Titan's icy mantle is less viscous than Earth's magma mantle, and because its icy bedrock is softer than Earth's granite bedrock, mountains are unlikely to reach heights as great as those on Earth. In 2016, the Cassini team announced what they believe to be the tallest mountain on Titan. Located in the Mithrim Montes range, it is 3,337 m tall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cassini Spies Titan's Tallest Peaks|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/cassini-spies-titans-tallest-peaks|publisher=NASA|year=2016|access-date=August 12, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819154049/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/cassini-spies-titans-tallest-peaks/|archive-date=August 19, 2016}}</ref>

If volcanism on Titan really exists, the hypothesis is that it is driven by energy released from the decay of radioactive elements within the mantle, as it is on Earth.<ref name="longstaff" /> Magma on Earth is made of liquid rock, which is less dense than the solid rocky crust through which it erupts. Because ice is less dense than water, Titan's watery magma would be denser than its solid icy crust. This means that cryovolcanism on Titan would require a large amount of additional energy to operate, possibly via [[tidal flexing]] from nearby Saturn.<ref name="longstaff" /> <!--Alternatively, the pressure necessary to drive the cryovolcanoes may be caused by the weight of the ice shell.{{cn}}--> The low-pressure ice, overlaying a liquid layer of [[ammonium sulfate]], ascends buoyantly, and the unstable system can produce dramatic plume events.

Titan's modern geology would have formed only after the crust thickened to 50 kilometers and thus impeded constant cryovolcanic resurfacing, with any cryovolcanism occurring since that time producing much more viscous water magma with larger fractions of ammonia and methanol; this would also suggest that Titan's methane is no longer being actively added to its atmosphere and could be depleted entirely within a few tens of millions of years.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wood|first=C.A|title=Titan's Global Crustal Thickening Event|url=https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/3032.pdf|access-date=26 February 2021|website=[[Universities Space Research Association]]|archive-date=July 1, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210701174116/https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/3032.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

The dunes break up around mountains, where the wind direction shifts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

The longitudinal (or linear) dunes were initially presumed to be formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material. Recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes may be the result of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in [[equinox]].

Titan is never visible to the naked eye, but can be observed through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benton |first=Julius L.

Observations of Titan prior to the space age were limited. In 1907 Spanish astronomer [[Josep Comas i Solà]] observed [[limb darkening]] of Titan, the first evidence that the body has an atmosphere. In 1944 [[Gerard P. Kuiper]] used a [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic technique]] to detect an atmosphere of methane.<ref name="Kuiper">{{cite journal |last=Kuiper |first=G.

Even with the data provided by the ''Voyagers'', Titan remained a body of mystery—a large satellite shrouded in an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult.

The ''Cassini–Huygens'' spacecraft reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, and began the process of mapping Titan's surface by [[radar]]. A joint project of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and [[NASA]], ''Cassini–Huygens'' proved a very successful mission. The ''Cassini'' probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only {{convert|1200|km|mi|sp=us}}, discerning patches of light and dark that would be invisible to the human eye.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

The [[Huygens probe|''Huygens'' probe]] landed just off the easternmost tip of a bright region now called [[Adiri (Titan)|Adiri]]. The probe photographed pale hills with dark "rivers" running down to a dark plain. Current understanding is that the hills (also referred to as highlands) are composed mainly of water ice. Dark organic compounds, created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, may rain from Titan's atmosphere. They are washed down the hills with the methane rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales.<ref name="Seeing_Touching_Titan-ESA">{{cite news |url=https://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMHB881Y3E_0.html |title=Seeing, touching and smelling the extraordinarily Earth-like world of Titan |publisher=ESA News, European Space Agency |date=January 21, 2005 |access-date=March 28, 2005 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007111129/https://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMHB881Y3E_0.html |archive-date=October 7, 2011  }}</ref>

===Possible subsurface habitats===
Laboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth. The analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable; several hypotheses postulate that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Artemivia |first1=N. |last2=Lunine |first2=Jonathan I. |title=Cratering on Titan: impact melt, ejecta, and the fate of surface organics |date=2003 |journal=Icarus |volume=164 |issue=2 |pages=471–480 |doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00148-9 |bibcode=2003Icar..164..471A }}</ref> It has also been hypothesized that liquid-ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface.<ref name="Grasset2000" /><ref>{{cite journal |last=Lovett |first=Richard A. |date=March 20, 2008 |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080320-titan-ocean_2.html |title=Saturn Moon Titan May Have Underground Ocean |journal=National Geographic |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018035136/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080320-titan-ocean_2.html |archive-date=October 18, 2012  }}</ref> Another model suggests an ammonia–water solution as much as {{convert|200|km|mi|sp=us}} deep beneath a water-ice crust with conditions that, although extreme by terrestrial standards, are such that life could survive.<ref name="Fortes2000" /> [[Heat transfer]] between the interior and upper layers would be critical in sustaining any subsurface oceanic life.<ref name="Grasset2000" /> Detection of microbial life on Titan would depend on its biogenic effects, with the atmospheric methane and nitrogen examined.<ref name="Fortes2000" />

===Methane and life at the surface===
{{see also|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}

It has been speculated that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water.<ref name=mckay/> Such organisms would inhale H<sub>2</sub> in place of O<sub>2</sub>, metabolize it with [[acetylene]] instead of [[glucose]], and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.<ref name="life?" /><ref name="mckay" /> However, such hypothetical organisms would be required to metabolize at a deep freeze temperature of {{cvt|-179.2|C|F K|abbr=}}.<ref name='A Mag Cooper'/>

All life forms on Earth (including [[methanogen]]s) use liquid water as a solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane,<ref name="methanesolvent">{{cite book |work=Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council |url=https://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=74 |title=The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems |publisher=The National Academies Press |date=2007 |page=74 |doi=10.17226/11919 |isbn=978-0-309-10484-5 |access-date=February 20, 2022 |archive-date=August 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820025541/http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=74 |url-status=live }}</ref> although water is a stronger solvent than methane.<ref name="methlife" /> Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through [[hydrolysis]].<ref name="methanesolvent" /> A life form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.<ref name="methanesolvent" />

In 2005, [[astrobiologist]] [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Chris McKay]] argued that if methanogenic life did exist on the surface of Titan, it would likely have a measurable effect on the mixing ratio in the Titan troposphere: levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected. Assuming metabolic rates similar to those of methanogenic organisms on Earth, the concentration of molecular hydrogen would drop by a factor of 1000 on the Titanian surface solely due to a hypothetical biological sink. McKay noted that, if life is indeed present, the low temperatures on Titan would result in very slow metabolic processes, which could conceivably be hastened by the use of catalysts similar to enzymes. He also noted that the low solubility of organic compounds in methane presents a more significant challenge to any possible form of life. Forms of [[active transport]], and organisms with large [[Surface-area-to-volume ratio|surface-to-volume ratios]] could theoretically lessen the disadvantages posed by this fact.<ref name="mckay">{{cite journal |journal=Icarus |volume=178 |issue=1 |pages=274–276 |date=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018 |title=Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan |last1=McKay |first1=C.

In 2010, Darrell Strobel, from [[Johns Hopkins University]], identified a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward flow at a rate of roughly 10<sup>28</sup> molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan's surface; as Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects McKay had predicted if [[methanogenic]] life-forms were present.<ref name="mckay" /><ref name="methlife">{{cite web|title=What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan? |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=2010 |access-date=June 6, 2010 |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185640/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190 |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan's atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions |last=Strobel |first=Darrell F. |journal=Icarus |volume=208 |issue=2 |pages=878–886 |date=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.003 |url=https://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf |bibcode=2010Icar..208..878S |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824195338/https://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf |archive-date=August 24, 2012 }}</ref> The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms consuming hydrocarbons.<ref name="methlife" /> Although restating the biological hypothesis, he cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a surface [[catalyst]] accepting hydrocarbons or hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow.<ref name="life?" /> Composition data and transport models need to be substantiated, etc. Even so, despite saying that a non-biological catalytic explanation would be less startling than a biological one, McKay noted that the discovery of a catalyst effective at {{convert|95|K|°C|-1|abbr=on}} would still be significant.<ref name="life?" />

As NASA notes in its news article on the June 2010 findings: "To date, methane-based life forms are only hypothetical. Scientists have not yet detected this form of life anywhere."<ref name="methlife" /> As the NASA statement also says: "some scientists believe these chemical signatures bolster the argument for a primitive, exotic form of life or precursor to life on Titan's surface."<ref name="methlife" />

In February 2015, a hypothetical [[cell membrane]] capable of functioning in liquid [[methane]] at cryogenic temperatures (deep freeze) conditions was modeled. Composed of small molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, it would have the same stability and flexibility as cell membranes on Earth, which are composed of [[phospholipid]]s, compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and [[phosphorus]]. This hypothetical cell membrane was termed an "[[azotosome]]", a combination of "azote", French for nitrogen, and "[[liposome]]".<ref name=azotosomemodel>{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-life-saturn-moon-titan.html|title=Life 'not as we know it' possible on Saturn's moon Titan|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317002959/https://phys.org/news/2015-02-life-saturn-moon-titan.html|archive-date=March 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stevenson |first1=James |last2=Lunine|first2=Jonathan I. |last3=Clancy |first3=Paulette |title=Membrane alternatives in worlds without oxygen: Creation of an azotosome |journal=Science Advances |date=February 27, 2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=e1400067 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1400067 |pmid=26601130 |bibcode=2015SciA....1E0067S |pmc=4644080 }}</ref>

===Obstacles===
Despite these biological possibilities, there are formidable obstacles to life on Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the [[Sun]], Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO<sub>2</sub>. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as [[Jonathan Lunine]] have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life than as an experiment for examining hypotheses on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html |title=Saturn's Moon Titan: Prebiotic Laboratory -- Interview with Jonathan Lunine |first=Henry |last=Bortman |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=August 11, 2004 |archive-date=August 28, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040828233135/https://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html |access-date=August 11, 2004 }}</ref> Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere.<ref name="Raulin2005">{{cite journal |journal=Space Science Reviews |volume=116 |issue=1–2 |pages=471–487 |date=2005 |doi=10.1007/s11214-005-1967-x |title=Exo-astrobiological aspects of Europa and Titan: From observations to speculations |last=Raulin |first=F. |bibcode=2005SSRv..116..471R |s2cid=121543884 }}</ref> Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.<ref name="Raulin2002" />

===Panspermia hypothesis===
It is hypothesized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface may have caused fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity, suggesting the possibility of [[panspermia]]. Calculations indicate that these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4819370.stm |title=Earth could seed Titan with life |work=BBC News |date=March 18, 2006 |access-date=March 10, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031002211/https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4819370.stm |archive-date=October 31, 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gladman |first1=Brett |last2=Dones |first2=Luke |last3=Levinson |first3=Harold F. |last4=Burns |first4=Joseph A. |title=Impact Seeding and Reseeding in the Inner Solar System |date=2005 |journal=Astrobiology |volume=5 |pages=483–496 |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.483 |pmid=16078867 |issue=4 |bibcode=2005AsBio...5..483G }}</ref> On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan's cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other.<ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=0908.0762 |last=Lunine |first=Jonathan I. |title=Saturn's Titan: A Strict Test for Life's Cosmic Ubiquity |url=https://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/CCLunine1530402.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512013831/https://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/CCLunine1530402.pdf |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |volume=153 |issue=4 |page=403 |date=2008 |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |bibcode=2009arXiv0908.0762L |url-status=dead }} [https://archive.org/details/SaturnsTitan copy at archive.org]</ref>

===Future conditions===
Conditions on Titan could become far more [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] in the far future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a [[red giant]], its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Change in the Solar System |author=The National Air and Space Museum |date=2012 |url=https://blog.nasm.si.edu/2012/03/07/climate-change-in-the-solar-system/ |access-date=January 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311101403/https://blog.nasm.si.edu/2012/03/07/climate-change-in-the-solar-system/ |archive-date=March 11, 2012  }}</ref> As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on the surface and enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Titan under a red giant sun: A new kind of "habitable" moon |last1=Lorenz |first1=Ralph D. |last2=Lunine |first2=Jonathan I. |last3=McKay |first3=Christopher P. |journal=NASA Ames Research Center, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, Department of Planetary Sciences, University of Arizona |date=1997 |volume=24 |issue=22 |pages=2905–8 |doi=10.1029/97gl52843 |pmid=11542268 |citeseerx=10.1.1.683.8827 |url=https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/redgiant.pdf |access-date=March 21, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173621/https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/redgiant.pdf |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |bibcode=1997GeoRL..24.2905L }}</ref>
