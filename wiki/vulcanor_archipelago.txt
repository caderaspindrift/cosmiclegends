The '''Vulcanor archipelago''' is an island chain located in the [[:w:South_Pacific|South_Pacific]] on
the planet [[clu:Earth|Earth]].

There are three major islands in the archipelago that range in size between 1,000 square miles
(2,590 sq. km.) and 4,000 square miles (10,360 sq. km.). In addition, the archipelago contains
at least 70 small islands in the range of 100 square miles (259 sq. km.)
to 1,000 square miles (2,590 sq. km.), and numerous [[:w:Islet|islets]] of less than
100 square miles (259 sq. km.).

== Location ==

The archipelago is located between the island nations of [[:w:Japan|Japan]] and
[[:w:Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] in the [[:w:Philippine_Sea|Philippine_Sea]], at approximately
[[:w:latitude|latitude]] 32.0, [[:w:longitude|longitude]] 140.0.

Due to the [[clu:Vulcanor magnetic field|Vulcanor magnetic field]], the region around the archipelago became known as
the ''[[:w:Devil%27s_Sea]]'' or the ''Dragon's Triangle'', a region of the Pacific that has been
compared to the [[:w:Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic]]'s '''[[:w:Bermuda_Triangle|Bermuda_Triangle]]'''.

== Geography and Environment ==

Most of the larger islands of the archipelago were created through volcanic activity, and many of
the smaller ones as well. [[clu:Volcano island|Volcano island]], the largest of the volcanic islands, has three
active volcanoes and numerous volcanic vents.

The heat generated by volcanic activity, including [[:w:Submarine volcano|underwater volcanos]],
raises the heat in the archipelago by at least 10 °F (5.6 °C), resulting in a mean high temperature of
approximately 99 °F (37 °C) and a mean low temperature of 85 °F (29.4 °C) with little seasonal variation.
The general climate is ''[[:w:Tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]]'' and the archipelago
experiences frequent [[:w:Typhoons|typhoons]] in the months between July and October, inclusively.

== History ==

Current geological estimates place the creation of the islands at approximately 30 million years
ago during the [[:w:Oligocene|Oligocene]] epoch, as a result of volcanic activity.

Archeological evidence places the first human settlements in what would become known as the '''Vulcanor archipelago'''
at approximately the [[clu:18th Century B.C.E.|18th Century B.C.E.]]. Recovered relics suggest a cultural overlap with the
[[:w:Chamorro people|CHamoru]], an [[:w:Austronesian_peoples|Austronesian people]].

No relics older than 1,000 B.C.E. have been recovered, suggesting that after the
[[clu:Vulcanor|Vulcanors]] arrived, the CHamoru either abandoned the islands or were absorbed into the
civilization established by the refugees from [[clu:Visitor|Visitor]] experiments.

=== Arrival of the The Vulcanors ===

The Vulcanors were humans who were specifically adapted to life on [[:w:Lava_planet|volcanic worlds]] just
as the [[clu:Titanians|Titanians]] were adapted to life on [[:w:Ice_planet|frozen nitrogen-methane worlds]].

Revolting against their [[clu:Visitor|Visitor]] captors, they stole a shuttlecraft and escaped back to Earth.
The first two locations where they landed were much too cold for their altered, rocky, heat-resistant bodies;
eventually they landed in the '''Vulcanor archipelago''' and began to reverse-engineer the technology used
in the shuttle, creating a [[clu:Vulcanor magnetic field|cloaking field]] to hide their presence from the
Visitors.

This field also prevented their discovery by [[:w:Analysis_of_Western_European_colonialism_and_colonization|European colonizers]]
as well as neighboring [[:w:Austronesian_peoples|indigenous cultures]]. This period of isolation, with access to the
Visitors' shuttle, gave them centuries to develop a level of technology that surpassed that of 21st Century Western
society while Europe was in the [[:w:Dark_Ages_(historiography)|Dark Ages]].

=== Reveal of Vulcanor ===

The Vulcanors remained behind their magnetic field for centuries; as technology of the outside world improved during
the 20th Century, they began to take an interest in monitoring [[:w:Radio|radio communications]]
during [[clu:World War 2|World War 2]].

In [[clu:1956]], the Titanian [[clu:Titan (hero)|Ty'Tonn To'Rezz]] arrived and attempted to alert the people of
Earth to the [[clu:Third_Visitation|threat of the Visitors]]. [[clu:United_States_of_America|American]]
[[:w:Radio_broadcasting|news reports]] gave descriptions of the Visitors that were easily recognizable from
ancient Vulcanor history and legends.

The monarch of [[clu:Vulcanor (nation)|Vulcanor]], [[clu:Tachylus Vulcanor Rex|King Tachylus]], viewed these
news reports with increasing concern. Summoning his oldest son, [[clu:Obsidius Rex|prince Obsidius]], Tachylus
told the young man to make his way to [[clu:Sun City, U.S.A.|Sun City]], where Titan had formed an organization with
a number of super-powered beings known as the [[clu:Cosmic Legends of the Universe|Cosmic Legends]].

=== Deactivating the Cloaking Field ===

As part of their desire to fully participate in 20th Century global society, the Vulcanors attempted to turn off
the magnetic cloaking field that had been created thousands of years prior -- older than even the oldest member of
the long-lived [[clu:Vulcanor|Vulcanor]] species.

Obsidius's initial assignment was to request a visit from '''Ty'Tonn To'Rezz''' to [[clu:Volcano City|Volcano City]] to help their
scientists and technicians work out how to deactivate the cloaking field created by their ancestors. Armed with
[[clu:Titanian|Titanian]] science, To'Rezz assisted the Vulcanors in gaining control of the magnetic field and shutting it
down -- thus revealing the previously unknown Vulcanor archipelago to astonished outsiders.

=== Volcano Boy Joins the Cosmic Legends ===

Obsidius returned to Sun City with Titan, became known as '''Prince Obsidian''' and joined the Cosmic Legends as
'''Volcano Boy''' -- the first non-charter member of the team. He also served as a special envoy to the nations of
the outside world and later as the ambassador to the [[clu:United_States_of_America|United States]] and then the
[[:w:United Nations|United Nations]].

Volcano Boy's reckless and arrogant behavior as a member of the Cosmic Legends led to diplomatic incidents with
the outside world, including provoking a short-lived [[:w:Cold_war_(term)|cold war]] with [[:w:New_Zealand|New_Zealand]] in
[[clu:1981]].

=== Conflict with New Zealand ===

As a result of Obsidius insulting the [[:w:Robert Muldoon|Prime Minister]] of [[clu:New_Zealand|New_Zealand]], a
planned cooperative venture to establish a mutual defense pact and free-trade agreement between Vulcanor and New
Zealand fell apart.

During this period in 1981, the possibility of armed conflict between the two island nations appeared likely, and each
sought to make military and economic alliances with both local and global powers. Eventually diplomatic overtures
initiated by Australian politician and future Deputy Prime Minister [[:w:Lionel_Bowen|Lionel_Bowen]] brought both parties back
to negotiation tables and the crisis was resolved peacefully.
