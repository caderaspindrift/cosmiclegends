<h2 class="colbefore" id="toc-ethos">Ethos</h2>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> revolves around the following three pillars:</p>
<h3 id="self-expression">Self Expression</h3>
<p>The Power Word system and Crisis system are intentionally built to give players freedom to engage with problems in their own style. <span class="gamename"></span> lets you be yourself, and do things in your own way, without being left behind by your team.</p>
<h3 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h3>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> games is written to encourage the players to work together. Whether you’re combining your powers to use Power Combos or using your skills to overcome an opponent together, heroes in <span class="gamename"></span> succeed or fail as a team.</p>
<h3 id="difficult-choices">Difficult Choices</h3>
<p>The Edge Success system is built so that you have the freedom to choose failure. The Crisis system is built so that you can choose to take big hits. Good things and bad things happen to your hero, and both of these are in the your hands to choose. The Editor’s job is to give you those difficult choices.</p>
<div id="soapbox-no-fascists" class="soapbox">
<h2 id="no-fascists">No Fascists</h2>
<p>If you’re a fascist, you’re not welcome to play this game. It’s against the rules.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this and thinking, “You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist,” then you’re probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic.</p>
<p>Don’t play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. Watch some <a href="https://www.misterrogers.org/">Mister Roger’s Neighborhood</a> or something.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-preface">A Four-Color Bronze Age Superhero TTRPG</h2>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="four-color">“Four-Color”</h3>
<p>The term “four-color” refers to the printing process used in comics that led to most heroes having bold, primary colors for their uniforms, their bodies, their worlds.</p>
<p>One example is Superman’s hair having <em>blue</em> overtones – this was meant to display his hair as a lustrous black but the capabilities time precluded that.</p>
<p><em>Our</em> use of the term “four-color” doesn’t refer to the print process for this game but instead to the general tone of late Silver Age and Bronze Age comics – when primary-color superheroes of the ’50s and ’60s met the social issues of the ’70s and ’80s.</p>
<h3 id="the-super-friends">The Super Friends</h3>
<p>In case you didn’t notice, this game is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends">Super Friends</a> cartoon show that was on the air from 1973 to 1985 – also the years yours truly was age 5 and 16. It’s fair to say the show influenced how I view comics and superheroes in general.</p>
<p>The first season has this great opening monologue where the four heroes were “created from the cosmic legends of the universe!”</p>
<p>What on earth does <em>that</em> mean? How exactly was <em>Bruce Wayne</em> created from the <strong>cosmic legends of the universe</strong>?! I’ve never figured that out, but it does make a great title for this Bronze Age-inspired, four-color tabletop RPG.</p>
<h3 id="the-ages-of-comics">The Ages of Comics</h3>
<p>American comics fans and scholars divide the history of comics into four loosely defined “ages”: the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Modern Age.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The Golden Age - 1938 to 1956</dt>
<dd><p>The Golden Age started with the introduction of Superman and the concept of superheroes in general. Many of the most well-known characters, such as Wonder Woman and Captain America, were created during the Golden Age.</p>
<p>Some comics in the Golden Age were simplistic fun, while others featured dark themes, shocking gore, and vile villains. A lot of Nazis were punched in those comics, which is always a good thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, racism and sexism often were major themes in Golden Age comics; examples of anti-Asian hatred are all too easy to find.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Silver Age - 1956 to circa 1970</dt>
<dd><p>The Silver Age began when DC Comics created new versions of the Flash, Green Lantern, and others, then the Justice League of America. Marvel responded by creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Avengers, the Hulk, the X-Men, and more.</p>
<p>The Silver Age also saw the creation of the Comics Code Authority, a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic over the content of comics.</p>
<p>Superhero comics in the Silver Age followed a long list of restrictions banning everything from “horror” and “gore” to “vampires” and “cannibalism”. Heroes always won, villains always lost, and authority figures were portrayed with respect – at least, that’s what the Comics Code demanded.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Bronze Age - ca. 1970 to ca. 1985</dt>
<dd><p>The Bronze Age is less distinctly defined chronologically, but was a time when comics went through changes: becoming more socially relevant and less restrained by the CCA. More on that later.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Modern Age - ca. 1985 to present</dt>
<dd><p>The current age of comics is usually dated to DC’s <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> and Marvel’s <em>Secret Wars</em>.</p>
<p>Modern superhero comics often feature antiheroes, complex storylines, and mature themes. Many of the older characters were revamped to more contemporary versions.</p>
<p>The CCA also withered away to nothing as the major publishers increasingly created comics without the CCA seal on the cover.</p>
</dd>

<p><span class="lorem"></span> <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-safety">Safety Tools</h2>
<p>Safety tools are a way for players and Editors to communicate and check-in <strong>before</strong>, <strong>during</strong>, and <strong>after</strong> a game in order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and to provide the right support when needed.</p>
<p>The key to safety tools is <strong>communication and trust</strong>. There needs to be open and respectful communication alongside a culture of trust for these to work.</p>
<p>Playing the <span class="gamename"></span> RPG should be enjoyable for everyone, and to help make that happen, we recommend the following techniques.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-game">Before the Game</h3>
<p>Before you even start playing an Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, talk about what you want to see in the game – and what you don’t want to see.</p>
<p>If you’re planning a long, open-ended Series, you may even want to devoted a whole session to this – called an <em>Issue 0</em> in <span class="gamename"></span>; for shorter games you should at least touch on these topics.</p>
<h4 id="lines-and-veils">Lines and Veils</h4>
<p><strong>Lines and veils</strong> are used to set boundaries on content in a game.</p>
<p><strong>Lines</strong> are hard limits on content, things that the Editor or the players don’t want to engage in. Setting up a line means that content won’t show up in the game at all.</p>
<p><strong>Veils</strong> are soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means that the content might be in the game but not spotlighted or described in great detail.</p>
<p><strong>Lines and veils</strong> can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.</p>
<h4 id="toc-comics-code">Using the Comics Code</h4>
<p>Don’t worry, I promise the CCA isn’t going to shut down your game.</p>
<p>Despite how terrible the <a href="http://cbldf.org/the-comics-code-of-1954/">Comics Code</a> was in reality – and it had a <em>stifling</em> effect on freedom of expression in comics for decades – it <em>does</em> give an interesting snapshot of the types of content that might show up in a Bronze Age superhero game.</p>
<p>The following questions are inspired by items in the Comics Code and are intended to start conversations – not end them!</p>
<p>As you discuss these questions as a group, anyone should feel free to request a line or veil on these or any other subjects.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="colbefore" id="during-the-game">During the Game</h3>
<p>When you get caught up in playing <span class="gamename"></span>, it can sometimes be hard to gauge how everyone else is feeling. These tools can be used while you’re playing to make it easier to share.</p>
<h4 id="breaks">Breaks</h4>
<p>For Issues that run longer than 2 hours or Issues that have intense content, having a short built-in break is recommended to allow people to stay focused and process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any other needs during this time.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Editor should offer a break after a Crisis concludes. The players might not want one, in which case the game continues.</p>
<h4 id="open-door">Open Door</h4>
<p>The <strong>Open Door</strong> is the assurance that someone can leave or take a break from the game for their own safety and well-being without being judged. State this at the beginning and periodically throughout the game.</p>
<h4 id="toc-script-change">Comic Page Change Tools</h4>
<p>During play, you can use <strong>Comic Script Change Tools</strong> to adjust play and content. They can be used by tapping physical cards with the words written on them, typing the first letter of the move in the chat function of the video conference software or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand signals.</p>
<p>Before each Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, Editors and players should discuss how to use each of these tools.</p>
<p><strong>Retcon</strong> can be used when something has happened in play that makes a participant uncomfortable. When <strong>Retcon</strong> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to retcon…”), be clear about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a point before it happened, and play starts again.</p>
<p><strong>Later That Day, …</strong> can be used when a participant would like to skip past uncomfortable content or to the next part of the story for pacing. When <strong>Later</strong> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to go to later that day…”), skip forward to a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, …</strong> can be used when everyone is ready to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing content. When <strong>Meanwhile</strong> used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“Meanwhile…?”), continue with play if everyone agrees they’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>Continued Next Page</strong> can be used when things are too intense, but you still want to continue playing the scene. When <strong>Continued</strong> is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud (“I’d like to continue to the next page…”), you can take a break and/or discuss the content as needed. After the <strong>Continued</strong>, you can use <strong>Meanwhile</strong>, <strong>Retcon</strong>, or <strong>Later</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="after-the-game">After the Game</h3>
<p>When you finish an Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, it’s important to look back at the things you enjoyed the most and the things you didn’t like as much.</p>
<h4 id="bleed">Bleed</h4>
<p>Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships between players and Editor if not worked through.</p>
<p>Being open and honest about where the game begins and ends, and being conscious of which feelings belong to the player and which are just bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.</p>
<h4 id="toc-stars-wishes">Stars and Wishes</h4>
<p><strong>Stars and wishes</strong> are used to reflect on the session and communicate feedback in a positive and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go around and get everyone to state a star and wish.</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong> are things that the participants really enjoyed and loved about the game. This could include a particular moment of roleplay, a Crisis created by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as something awesome during the game.</p>
<p><strong>Wishes</strong> are things that the participants would like to see in future sessions. This could include particular interactions between heroes, potential story moments and development, or anything else that could make the game even better in the future.</p>

<h2>CODE OF THE COMICS MAGAZINE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC.</h2>
<h3 id="adopted-october-26-1954">Adopted October 26, 1954</h3>
<h4 id="preamble">PREAMBLE</h4>
<p>The comic-book medium, having come of age on the American cultural scene, must measure up to its responsibilities.</p>
<p>Constantly improving techniques and higher standards go hand in hand with these responsibilities.</p>
<p>To make a positive contribution to contemporary life, the industry must seek new areas for developing sound, wholesome entertainment. The people responsible for writing, drawing, printing, publishing, and selling comic books have done a commendable job in the past, and have been striving toward this goal.</p>
<p>Their record of progress and continuing improvement compares favorably with other media in the communications industry. An outstanding example is the development of comic books as a unique and effective tool for instruction and education. Comic books have also made their contribution in the field of letters and criticism of contemporary life.</p>
<p>In keeping with the American tradition, the members of this industry will and must continue to work together in the future.</p>
<p>In the same tradition, members of the industry must see to it that gains made in this medium are not lost and that violations of standards of good taste, which might tend toward corruption of the comic book as an instructive and wholesome form of entertainment, will be eliminated.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Comics Magazine Association of America, Inc. has adopted this code, and placed strong powers of enforcement in the hands of an independent code authority.</p>
<p>Further, members of the association have endorsed the purpose and spirit of this code as a vital instrument to the growth of the industry.</p>
<p>To this end, they have pledged themselves to conscientiously adhere to its principles and to abide by all decisions based on the code made by the administrator.</p>
<p>They are confident that this positive and forthright statement will provide an effective bulwark for the protection and enhancement of the American reading public, and that it will become a landmark in the history of self-regulation for the entire communications industry.</p>

<p><strong>Issue 0</strong> – known as <em>Session 0</em> in other games – is an Issue of a <span class="gamename"></span> Series when the players don’t roll dice and handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person is looking forward to playing.</p>
<p>Issue 0 takes place before the First Issue, and should go over the safety tools used in the game, stress the importance of open communication, and set expectations on the kind of story and play.</p>
<p>Issue 0s are also a great time to create heroes together as a group, rather than separately.</p>

<p>During an Issue, the Editor and the players play out the events of a <strong>Storyline</strong>.</p>
<p>When you create a new hero, you define a specific lesson you’d like your hero to learn or a specific experience you’d like them to have. For that Storyline, your character is considered the <strong>Spotlight</strong> hero.</p>
<p>Each Storyline consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Spotlight hero</li>
<li>the Opportunity</li>
<li>one or more Crises connected to the Opportunity, introduced by the Editor</li>
<li>the heroes’ reactions to each Crisis</li>
<li>the Spotlight hero’s reaction the Opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Storylines will resolve over the course of one Issue, but some can take long and might run for 2 or 3 sessions, or longer.</p>
<p>Once your hero finishes your Storyline, both your hero and your fellow players’ heroes gain an <strong>Advancement.</strong></p>

<p>A <strong>One-Shot</strong> is an Issue that isn’t part of a Storyline, Volume, or Series, but stands alone. Most games played at conventions, for example, will be One-Shots.</p>
<p>Sometimes a One-Shot doesn’t have a Spotlight hero, meaning there’s no Opportunity either, but just a connected series of Crises. In those cases, all heroes receive a standard Advancement after dealing with all the Crises.</p>
<p>One-Shots obviously won’t have a separate Issue 0, but time should still be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on important safety tools.</p>
<h3 id="guest-stars-and-crossovers">Guest Stars and Crossovers</h3>
<p>A <strong>Guest Star</strong> is a hero character from another Series – either played by the same group or a different one – who plays in the Series for an Issue or two. If the Guest Star’s Volume number is higher than the group’s, temporarily lower the Guest Star to the same Volume.</p>
<p>A <strong>Crossover</strong> happens when the heroes from two or more Series work together, usually in large, wide-ranging One-Shots. All participating heroes keep their normal Volume numbers without adjustment.</p>

<div class="chargen-list">
<ol type="1">
<li>Pick a <strong>Class</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gain 2 <strong>Core Power Words</strong></li>
<li>Pick six <strong>Personal Power Words</strong> from your Class list</li>
<li>Choose 2 words as your <strong>Nova Power Words</strong></li>
<li>Pick your <strong>Skills</strong>, based on your Class</li>
<li>Pick a <strong>Volume</strong> 1 ability from your Class</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assign 1 point to each <strong>Approach</strong>, then distribute more 5 points as you wish</li>
<li>Pick a <strong>Fighting Style</strong></li>
<li>Choose 5 words as <strong>Ideals</strong></li>
<li>Describe a <strong>Storyline</strong> you’d like to play out with your hero</li>
<li>Choose your hero’s <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Pronouns</strong>, and <strong>Looks</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="hero-class">Hero Class</h3>
<p>A hero’s <em>Class</em> defines broad strokes of their powers, abilities, and methods. Classes are archetypes that define how your hero fits into a superhero world.</p>
<p>Each class gives the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two or more skills</li>
<li>A class ability</li>
<li>Two Core Power Words</li>
<li>Six Personal Power words</li>
<li>One class ability per Volume</li>
<li>An additional class ability at Volume 1</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc-skills-chargen">Skills</h3>
<p>Skills define what your hero does does outside of their life as a superhero – they could be from before gaining powers, or they might be what they still do now.</p>
<p>When you create your hero, your class may give you several Skills for free; in addition, you have at least 2 free picks.</p>
<section id="approaches" class="soapbox approaches">
<h3>Approaches</h3>
<p>These Approaches – named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles – were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, or as wise or charming as they like.</p>
<p>The other reason for these Approaches is that the concept of Intelligence as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, including racial and class injustice.</p>
<p>We chose “Detective” as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve problems by thinking about them and gathering information, not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="toc-approaches">Approaches</h3>
<p>Each hero’s nature is defined by their scores in 5 different Approaches, which represent their preferred methods to solve problems.</p>
<div class="chargen-list">
<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong> - a direct, straight-forward approach</li>
<li><strong>Adventure</strong> - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations</li>
<li><strong>Detective</strong> - a logical approach, based on gathering information</li>
<li><strong>Mystery</strong> - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions</li>
<li><strong>Suspense</strong> - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Each of your hero’s Approaches starts with a score of 1, and you have 5 additional points to distribute to them.</p>
<h3 id="abilities">Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>blurb about abilities</strong> <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<p>Your hero class has a number of abilities associated with it. You automatically can use the ability common to all members of the same hero class, called the Prime Ability.</p>
<p>At the start of each Volume you can pick one ability from that Volume’s list or lower; in addition, you get an extra ability at the start of Volume 1.</p>
<p>You can take any given ability only once; either you have it or you don’t have it. There are a few abilities that are excepts to this rule, and they specifically that you can take them more than once.</p>
<p>The following diagram summarizes the abilities gained at each Volume.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="toc-fighting-style">Fighting Style</h3>
<p>Your hero specializes in one style of fighting, whether they attack with their fists or their powers. Those styles are:</p>
<div class="chargen-list breakable">
<ul>
<li><strong>Acrobat</strong> Reduce by 1 the cost to counter a Crisis move targeting only you.</li>
<li><strong>Ace</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a Vehicle power word to roll to advance any goal.</li>
<li><strong>Brawler</strong> Add 2 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal.</li>
<li><strong>Controller</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a Power to advance the Outwit goal.</li>
<li><strong>Demolisher</strong> Add 2 dice when you roll to advance the Smash Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Frenzy</strong> Add 2 dice when you use any Personal power word to advance the Smash Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Find Weakness</strong> Add 2 dice when you roll with Suspense to advance the Smash Goal.</li>
<li><strong>Guerilla</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a Scene power word to roll to advance any goal or add to the Teamwork Pool.</li>
<li><strong>Interceptor</strong> Reduce by 1 the cost to Take the Hit for someone else.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration</strong> Add 2 dice when you roll to add to the Teamwork Pool or advance the Allay goal.</li>
<li><strong>Harrier</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a Flight power word to roll to advance the Outwit goal.</li>

<li><strong>Weapon Master</strong> Add 2 dice when you use a melee Weapon power word to advance the Outwit goal.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you choose the Knight class, you get to pick an additional fighting style before Volume One.</p>
<h3 id="toc-ideals">Ideals</h3>
<p>Your hero has five Ideals that drive them to feats of heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen by you when you create your hero; there’s no set list.</p>
<p>For example, one hero could have these five Ideals:</p>
<div class="chargen-list twocolumn">
<ul>
<li><strong>Truth</strong></li>
<li><strong>Justice</strong></li>
<li><strong>Responsibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Restraint</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<p>When you use all five of your hero’s Ideals in a Storyline, your hero’s Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you unlock your Nova Power Words. You can use those Nova Power Words until the end of current Storyline.</p>
<p>When a new Storyline begins, all the marked off Ideals are cleared and it’s time to start again.</p>
<h4 id="random-ideals">Random Ideals</h4>

<h3 id="toc-powers">Power Words</h3>
<p>Your hero has a list of words called Power Words that define their super-powers and how they use them. Power Words are used in three different ways:</p>
<div class="chargen-list">
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Power Display</strong>, which uses a single Power Word</li>
<li>A <strong>Power Stunt</strong>, using two (or more) Power Words</li>
<li>A <strong>Power Combo</strong>, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>There are four types of Power Words:</p>
<div class="chargen-list">
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Power Words</strong>, unique to your class</li>
<li><strong>Personal Power Words</strong>, picked from your class list</li>
<li><strong>Nova Power Words</strong>, unique to your hero</li>
<li><strong>Scene Power Words</strong>, based on the situation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-core">Core Power Words</h4>
<p>When you create your hero, you have two <strong>Core Power Words</strong> common to all members of your class. You don’t have to choose them; you get them automatically.</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-personal">Personal Power Words</h4>
<p>In addition to Core Power Words, your hero also has 6 Personal Power Words. When you create your hero, choose these 6 from your class’s list of 15 Personal Power Words. (If your class is Paragon, pick an extra one from your class, and another from any class’s list.)</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-nova">Nova Power Words</h4>
<p>Your <strong>Nova Power Powers</strong> can be anything; you’re encouraged to use your Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.</p>
<p>Like Ideals, you can choose any two words you like for your hero’s Nova Power Words.</p>
<p>Nova Power Words might look like this:</p>
<div class="chargen-list twocolumn">
<ul>
<li><strong>Soaring Dragon</strong></li>
<li><strong>Berserker Rage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Indomitable Spirit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Solar Flare</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When you’ve checked off each of your hero’s Ideals, you unlock your <strong>Nova Power Words</strong> and can use them until the end of the current Storyline.</p>
<h4 id="toc-power-words-scene">Scene Power Words</h4>
<p>Each scene where a Crisis takes places has up to 6 Power Words that describe the environment around your heroes. These are known as <strong>Scene Power Words.</strong></p>
<p>The Editor comes up with Scene Power Words when describing a location, and if you think creatively, you can use them in your Power Stunts and Combos.</p>
<h3 id="toc-chargen-identity">Your Hero’s Identity</h3>
<p>“Identity” is a general term, and you can define it however you like for your hero. It could include their racial or cultural identity, their sexual or gender identity, their physical appearance, their pronouns, their disabilities (if any), their age, or any-or-all of these.</p>
<p>In addition, you can decide if your hero is a normal human; a human changed through an experiment or magic; a strange visitor from another world; an artificial life form; a time-traveler; or anything else you can imagine.</p>
<p><em>Most</em> heroes will go by two names – one being their personal, non-superhero name and the other being their superhero code-name.</p>
<p>It’s up to you if everyone knows your hero by both names, or if one is a <em>Secret Identity</em> only shared with a few.</p>
<p>You can also decide if your hero has the same general characteristics in all identities, or if they change from identity to the next: are they taller or shorter in their secret ID? Do they have the same gender in each identity?</p>
<p>Use your imagination, and don’t be afraid to bounce ideas off your fellow players and the Editor if you get stuck.</p>
<h3 id="toc-storyline">Initial Storyline</h3>
<p>A <strong>Storyline</strong> is one or more connected Issues focusing on one hero, known as the <strong>Spotlight</strong> hero. At a climactic part of the Storyline, the Spotlight hero has an <strong>Opportunity</strong> to change – the chance to evaluate their assumptions and decisions, and react accordingly.</p>
<p>Once in each Volume, your hero gets to play through one Storyline where they have the Spotlight. You get to define what their <em>Opportunity</em> will be – it could be an important lesson they get to learn, or a piece of information about their origin they’d never known, or an experience you think will force them to make a difficult moral decision.</p>
<p>There are five rules for creating an Opportunity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Your Hero is the <em>Star</em></strong> - An Opportunity can’t be focused on a group decision or a side character’s experiences, except for how that affects your hero.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You <em>Want</em> to Play Through It</strong> - The Editor will plan Crises based on the assumption that if you ask for an Opportunity, it represents something you actually want to have happen to your hero in the game. If you <em>aren’t</em> interested in it, then don’t ask for it!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change is Never <em>Easy</em></strong> - This means that you should expect that any Opportunity you create represents something that your hero can’t just easily dismiss or shrug off. If you say you want an Opportunity of being asked to join a villain team, then that should represent an actual struggle for your hero.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change is <em>Not</em> Required</strong> - An Opportunity is just that: the <em>chance</em> for a change. But it’s completely valid for your hero to come to that Opportunity and decide they <em>aren’t</em> going to change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Play to Find Out</strong> - Don’t pick the outcome, just the Opportunity! In other words, <em>don’t</em> come up with both the Opportunity <em>and</em> the result of the Storyline; be open to seeing where the questions will take your hero and let yourself be surprised through the act of playing the game.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When you create your hero, choose one Opportunity based on these five rules; you can ask the Editor and your fellow players for advice as well.</p>
<p>At the end of any Storyline where your hero is <em>not</em> the Spotlight hero, you have option of changing your Opportunity – for exmaple, if you come up with a better idea during another her’s Spotlight.</p>
<h4 id="opportunity-examples">Opportunity Examples</h4>
<p>These are examples of the types of Opportunities you can create.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Brigantia needs to learn that not everything can be solved by punching something.</li>
<li>I want Percival to cross swords with another Arthurian knight.</li>
<li>Kelly wants to confront poachers who harm sea animals.</li>
<li>I want Jack to get asked out by some villain dude.</li>
<li>The Sentinel of Saturn needs to let humans make their own mistakes.</li>
<li>I want Rockstar to be invited to join a new band.</li>
<li>Lin wants to fight one of their mother’s supervillains.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their civilian life – from their secret identity, their profession before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training.</p>
<div class="twocolumn skill-column-list">
<p>The Skills are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic</li>
<li>Artist</li>
<li>Criminal</li>
<li>Deputy</li>
<li>Engineer</li>
<li>Explorer</li>

<li>Pilot</li>
<li>Politician</li>
<li>Scientist</li>
<li>Socialite</li>
<li>Spy</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as determined by your class, which may also give additional skills.</p>
<h3 id="using-skills">Using Skills</h3>
<p>When you make a roll that could be affected by one of your Skills, you add a number of dice to the dice pool equal to the current Volume.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a Skill, you don’t add any extra dice to the pool.</p>
<h3 id="skill-descriptions">Skill Descriptions</h3>
<p>The skills in <span class="gamename"></span> are listed below, along with 3 to 5 suggestions how you could use the skill with your hero’s Approaches and consequences the Editor can propose on an Edge Success.</p>

<h4 id="playing-a-construct">Playing a Construct</h4>
<p>Your hero is really, really good at breaking things. You’re going to want to advance the Smash goal whenever you can, but keep in mind that you’re more than <em>just</em> muscle.

</ul></li>
<li>Are you <em>always</em> a monster?<br />
(If not, then you may want to consider playing your hero as <a href="#toc-multi-class">a Multi-Class Hero</a>.)
<ul>
<li>If not, what triggers that change?</li>
<li>Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, or your own free will?</li>
<li>Will people not like you when you’re angry? Why not?</li>
<li><em>Were</em> you always a monster?</li>

<li>What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people?

<li>Why <em>aren’t</em> you the monster they say you are?

<h4 id="playing-a-divine">Playing a Divine</h4>
<p>As a Divine hero, you have a wide range of abilities to choose from. Look for ways you can find synergy with other heroes – if they join in a Power Combo that you initiate, your <em>Give Me Strength!</em> bonus applies to the dice they provide, too.</p>
<h4 id="questions-1">Questions</h4>
<p>As you create your Divine hero, answer any or all of these questions.</p>
<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>Are you a deity yourself?
<ul>
<li>A demigod?</li>
<li>The champion of one or more deities?</li>
<li>Or even someone who figuratively or literally stole power from the gods?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What god, gods or pantheon are you associated with?
<ul>
<li>Do you gain power from your association with a single deity, or do multiple gods grant you power?</li>
<li>Are your powers bestowed by the gods, or are they a result of your own divine essence?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do you relate to the god(s) who empower you?
<ul>
<li>Are you on good terms with them, are they distant and silent, or have they sent you to a mortal existence for your own good?</li>
<li>Are there other gods or other people empowered by the gods, and if so, do you get along with them?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are there any mythological monsters or enemies that your choice of a divine power source implies?</li>
<li>Do you have a single form and identity, or do you change through supernatural means between your Divine form and a “mortal” one?
<ul>
<li>If so, what triggers such a change – a spoken word, a transformation sequence, or just calling upon your Divine powers?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you’re not a mortal yourself, what <em>do</em> you think of the mortal world?
<ul>
<li>Does it mystify you, or are you thoroughly immersed in modern culture?</li>
<li>What are your views on religion – both your hero’s own religion and those that could be seen as rival faiths?</li>

<section id="real-world-religions" class="soapbox">
<h4>Real-World Religions?</h4>
<p>It’s a staple of superhero comic books that real-life deities are portrayed as either heroes themselves or the sources of power for a hero.</p>
<p>There’s an assumption that these “aren’t <em>real</em> gods who are sacred to anyone any more” – but that’s not necessarily true at all. For example, many modern pagans revere one or more of the Norse gods of myth.</p>
<p>You should be careful when you use mythological deities, <em>especially</em> those from a culture that’s foreign to you. Check with the other players and the Editor, and be prepared to change either your Divine hero or the concept behind them.</p>

<h3>Dual-Class Heroes</h3>
<p>A Dual-Class Hero is one who can change between a <em>primary class</em> and a <em>secondary class</em> form, and is likely a hero who looks different in each form. One might be a meek scientist while the other a rampaging monster; one could be a young student while the other is a dazzling magical star-princess.</p>
<p>Dual-Class Heroes are a way to build a hero who transforms to do their superheroic deeds, including magical girls and were-creatures.</p>
<p>When you create your Dual-Class Hero, you get to choose the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What they look like in their <em>primary class</em>.</li>
<li>What they look like in their <em>secondary class</em>.</li>
<li>How they change between <em>primary class</em> and <em>secondary class</em>, and how long that takes.</li>
<li>Their Class Abilities, Fighting Styles, Skills, and Personal Power Words for each class.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the start of each Season, you choose a new Class Ability for each of the two classes. Whenever you gain a new Fighting Style or Skill, assign it to one of the two classes; it can only be used when your hero is in that class or form.</p>
<p>Whenever you get to choose a new personal power word, choose one word for each class and add it to the Personal Power Words for that form. If your Health or Might advances, it applies to <em>both</em> class forms.</p>
<p>These stay consistent between <em>primary class</em> and <em>secondary class</em> for the same hero:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The values for their Approaches. (Action, Adventure, Detective, Mystery, and Suspense.)</li>
<li>Their Ideals, and whether they’ve tagged their keys for each Ideal.</li>
<li>Their Season (which is consistent for the Series).</li>
<li>Their (maximum) Health and (maximum) Might.</li>
<li>Whether they’ve unlocked their Nova Power Words this Storyline, whether they’re the Spotlight Hero, and their Advancements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Switching from <em>primary</em> to <em>secondary</em> class does the following: 0. Costs 1 Might or 1 Health. 1. Resets their current Health to its maximum value. 2. Keeps their Might at its current level.</p>
<p>Switching from <em>secondary</em> to <em>primary</em> class does the following: 0. Costs 1 Might or 1 Health. 1. Resets their current Might to its maximum value. 2. Keeps their Health at its current level.</p>

<h3>Character Sheets for Dual-Class Heroes</h3>
<p>The easiest way to run a dual-class hero is just maintain two different character sheets, and flip between them when the character changes form/class!</p>

<div id="class-dynamo" class="classdata">
<h3 class="breakbefore class" id="toc-dynamo">The Dynamo</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Stand back, everyone. This one’s gonna hurt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re a living source of energy. Whether you generate it yourself or tap into another plane of existence, you can use that energy as a blast, an explosion, a punch, and more.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-dynamo">Playing a Dynamo</h4>
<p>This makes you especially good at blowing things up; in fights, you use up Might quickly, but regain it almost as quickly. Dynamo is one of the few classes that gets a third Core Power Word, so use that to increase your dice pools by spending Might freely.</p>
<h4 id="questions-2">Questions</h4>
<p>As you create your Dynamo hero, answer any or all of these questions.</p>
<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>What type of energy do you use?
<ul>
<li>Do you produce it yourself, or does it come from another source?</li>
<li>How exactly did you gain your power to use this energy?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What visual, audible, and olfactory signatures accompany your power?
<ul>
<li>Is there a color associated with this energy, like silver, purple, or gold? Do you crackle with energy?</li>
<li>An earth-shattering kaboom when your power goes off, a simple “ZOT” or something else?</li>
<li>A burnt smell, or ozone, or petrichor?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does your hero feel about these powers?
<ul>
<li>Do you revel in them, happy to show off?</li>
<li>Or are you more restrained, afraid to let loose with your full strength?</li>
<li>Have your powers ever harmed anyone else?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="skills-2">Skills</h4>
<p>You have the Scientist skill, plus any two skills of your choice.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of dice equal to the Volume.</p>
<section id="other-energy-power-words" class="soapbox">
<h4>Other Energy Power Words</h4>
<p>If you’ve got an idea for another type of energy, go for it! You can run it past the Editor for ideas, but if you say your energy is “thunder”, for example, then your power’s thunder!</p>

<h4 id="power-words-2">Power Words</h4>
<p>You can use your Power Words in the following ways:</p>

<li>As a <strong>Power Combo</strong>, costing 1 Might and letting others join in</li>
<li>Joining a <strong>Power Combo</strong>, costing 1 Might.</li>

<li>Heat</li>

This partner has three Core Power Words – one matching your Totem Nature Power Word, and two others from the Totem Personal Power Words List – that you can use for free without spending Might, each once per Hero Phase. Your animal partner’s Health and Might equal the Volume.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Mystic Totem</dt>
<dd><p>Your link to your nature totem is a result of mystical means, not technological a strictly scientific process. You gain the Mystic skill. Whenever you choose a Personal Power Word, you can choose from the Mage Class Personal Power Words List or the Divine Class Personal Power Words List.</p>

<dt>Unkillable</dt>

</dd>
<dt>Unbeatable</dt>
<dd><p>Your powers cause people to under-estimate you and you actually punch can punch far above your normal weight class.

<h4>Real-World Religions?</h4>
<p>It’s a staple of superhero comic books that real-life deities are portrayed as either heroes themselves or the sources of power for a hero.</p>
<p>There’s an assumption that these “aren’t <em>real</em> gods who are sacred to anyone any more” – but that’s not necessarily true at all. For example, many modern pagans revere one or more of the Norse gods of myth.</p>
<p>You should be careful when you use mythological deities, <em>especially</em> those from a culture that’s foreign to you. Check with the other players and the Editor, and be prepared to change either your Hellspawn hero or the concept behind them.</p>

<h3 class="breakbefore class" id="toc-knight">The Knight</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most other heroes – with the exception of some Inventors – have superhuman powers and abilities. You’re not like them. Your own training and talents are what made you what you are; you may have powers, you may have high-tech devices, but ultimately it comes down to your skill against someone else’s.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-knight">Playing a Knight</h4>
<p>When you play your Knight hero, come up with ways to use your Power Words that reflect your normal abilities instead of any superpowers you possess. Other heroes – such as the Dynamo or the Paragon – focus on their powers, but you rely on your Skills, your specialized tools, and your Fighting Styles.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> combine your Fighting Styles with each other and with your Power Words, so look for synergies there – nearly every Knight has a <em>Weapon</em> Power Word for that reason. If you pick <em>Weapon</em> (or <em>Vehicle</em>), name the general kind of weapon – Rifle, Boomerang, Sword, Shield, and so on.</p>
<p>If you’re going to play a more realistic hero, consider the <em>Weapons Locker</em> ability for access to weapon Power Words, and devote your own Personal Power Words to expanding the variety of effects you can produce.</p>
<h4 id="questions-8">Questions</h4>
<p>As you create your Knight hero, answer any or all of these questions.</p>
<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>Why are you <em>so</em> driven?

<li>Did someone hurt you or you those you love, or are you motivated by a patroitic or professional calling?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What kinds of gear do you use?
<ul>
<li>How do you carry those – a quiver, a belt, a backpack, or pouches all over your costume?</li>
<li>Are your weapons and devices completely mundane, are they the result of unrealistic super-science, or are they supernatural in origin?</li>
<li>Did you create them, or did someone else?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do you have any powers, and if so, how did you come by them?
<ul>
<li>In what ways can you combine those with your more mundane talents?</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Are you on good or bad terms with them?</li>

<h3 class="breakbefore class" id="toc-monarch">The Monarch</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall forgive you but once for your disrespect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are a leader in a city, nation, or people who exist outside of mainstream international society.</p>
<p>Your ways may seem unorthodox and even arrogant to those unfamiliar with your culture, but their ignorance can be excused … mostly.</p>
<p>Although you fight for justice and freedom for all, you feel a special obligation to protect your home – even if you don’t currently live there.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-monarch">Playing a Monarch</h4>
<p>Your Monarch hero is most strongly defined by their home than by their Powers, Approaches, or Skills. You’re most effective against threats against that home.</p>
<p>It’s up to you to decide if any given Crisis endangers your domain, so you may want to ask the Editor or other players during the Countdown to Crisis about ideas to tie your home to the current situation.</p>
<h4 id="questions-10">Questions</h4>
<p>As you create your Monarch hero, answer any or all of these questions.</p>
<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>Where is your home located?
<ul>
<li>How does its location serve to isolate it from other cultures?</li>
<li>Is your home open to outsiders, or sealed off?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What kind of distinct cultural traditions from your home could be seen as strange to outsiders?
<ul>
<li>And conversely, what Western customs are either baffling or unacceptable to you?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which languages are spoken in your home?
<ul>
<li>Do the people of your home know any languages of outsiders?</li>
<li>Is there a particular accent common to your people?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are your powers common to everyone from your home, or are you unique?
<ul>
<li>Do your powers descend from your lineage?</li>
<li>Do you have additional abilities based on your rank as a leader?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What’s your current status in your home?
<ul>
<li>Do you live there?</li>
<li>Are you the reigning monarch, or an heir in line for the throne?</li>
<li>If you’re not the monarch regnant, who is, and how do you feel about each other?</li>
<li>Have you been exiled from your home, and if so – for what reason?</li>
</ul></li>

<h4>Cultural Sensitivity</h4>
<p>You can define any details you like about your Monarch’s home. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be aware of real-world stereotypes, bigotries, and privilege.</p>
<p>Your Monarch’s home is <em>never</em> somewhere that exists – or could exists – in the real world. You can live on the Moon, or in the Antarctic, or under the Pacific Ocean, or in an adjacent dimension, or on a floating city – but you can’t be the Monarch of China or Uganda or Pittsburgh.</p>

<h3 class="breakbefore class" id="toc-paragon">The Paragon</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry, but I can’t let you do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re convinced that your powers are meant to help others, not for your own benefit. You protect those who can’t defend themselves, help those who can’t help themselves.</p>
<p>You’re the epitome of a hero. Flight, strength, invulnerability, and superhuman verions of normal human abilities are common among Paragons, along with the odd random power usually found in another class.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-paragon">Playing a Paragon</h4>
<p>If you’re playing a Paragon because you want to revel in your hero’s power … then you’re probably playing the wrong class.</p>
<p>Paragons, despite often being the most powerful heroes <em>in concept</em>, are primarily support heroes. The class ability – <em>My One Weakness!</em> – takes your hero out of the fight but gives a boost to the other heroes!</p>
<p>Your Paragon may have more Health than other heroes – but that’s because, ideally, you’re using Take the Hit whenever you possibly can. Paragons are about protecting others first, and punching villains a distant second.</p>
<p>Also, look for creative ways to use your <em>Powers</em> and <em>Abilities</em> Core Power Words – they can justify any number of ad hoc power uses in combination with your other Power Words, such as <em>Vision Powers</em> or <em>Alien Abilities</em>. What do those mean? Whatever you say they mean!</p>
<h4 id="questions-12">Questions</h4>
<p>As you create your Paragon hero, answer any or all of these questions.</p>
<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>Why do normal people love you instead of fearing your power?
<ul>
<li>Why do <em>you</em> love humanity so much?</li>

<h3 class="breakbefore class" id="toc-psychic">The Psychic</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I know secrets about you that you don’t even know yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psychics are masters of mind powers, able to communicate with others and link minds together.</p>
<p>Their powers are often purely mental without a physical manifestation; a duel between two Psychics could take place in the middle of a crowded restaurant with no one any the wiser.</p>
<p>If normal people knew that a Psychic was among them – and could potentially access their innermost thoughts and desires! – they would react with fear and hostility. Some Psychics will pose as some other type of hero to avoid such prejudices … even as they admit such biases might not be entirely unwarranted.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-psychic">Playing a Psychic</h4>
<p>Your Psychic hero is likely the lynchpin of the team, although not necessarily the leader. This is a passive ability, though – unless you choose otherwise, everyone’s connected when you’re present – so look for ways to use your own Power Words, Skills, and Abilities in creative and original ways.</p>
<section id="no-ethical-mind-control-under-capitalism" class="soapbox">
<h4>No Ethical Mind Control Under Capitalism</h4>
<p>Many comic books and roleplaying games will gloss over it, but I’ll state it directly: nearly any use of mind control powers represents gross violations of another person’s autonomy and consent.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you can’t <em>ever</em> do that in an Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, but it means that you have to be careful and safe by checking in with the other players and the Editor – because your Psychic hero is probably doing something that’s quite horrific if you’re using mind control.</p>
<p>During Issue 0 or the start of an Issue, you should ask the other players and the Editor about whether they view reading someone’s mind without consent as the same kind of violation. Are surface thoughts fine, but deep memories not? You <em>need</em> to have these kinds of talks, as a group, before it comes up in play.</p>

<p>Everyone wave goodbye to him! Get it? Wave. Because I control waves. Nobody? Tough crowd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Shaper is able to control some physical – or quasi-physical – substance, such as rock, water, or shadows. Their powers have a greater effect on the world around them than most heroes’ do, such as controlling the weather or leveling buildings with a glance.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-shaper">Playing a Shaper</h4>
<p>Your Shaper hero focuses on two things: the type of matter you can control, and the environment around you.</p>
<p>Each scene has several Scene Power Words that are chosen by the Editor during the Countdown to Crisis. However, an Editor might not think of everything – so it’s fine for you to suggest that perhaps there might be a magazine stand on the street corner, for example, if your hero controls paper.</p>
<p>One of the first things you’re going to want to do is use your <em>Reshape the Battlefield</em> ability to give yourself and the other heroes Scene Power Words to use. Remember that a Scene Power Word costs 0 Might to use! Reshaping at the start of a Crisis can save you a <em>lot</em> of Might in the long run!</p>
<section id="other-element-power-words" class="soapbox">
<h4>Other Element Power Words</h4>
<p>If you can think of something else you’d like your Shaper hero to control, then choose that as your Element Power Word instead!

<h4 id="playing-a-kid-1">Playing a Kid</h4>
<p>You have Skills, Abilities, and possibly other Power Words that you can use to switch up your moves from Hero Phase to Hero Phase.</p>
<h4 id="questions-15">Questions</h4>
<p>As you create your Kid hero, answer any or all of these questions.</p>
<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>How do you look different from normal humans?
<ul>
<li>How much larger (or smaller) are you than other people?</li>
<li>What color is your skin, and what does it feel and look like?</li>
<li>What kind of strange appearance do you have that makes the ignorant assume you’re just an animalistic brute?</li>
<li>What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do you employ?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are you <em>always</em> a kid?<br />
(If not, then you may want to consider playing your hero as <a href="#toc-multi-class">Multi-Class Hero</a> – this is appropriate for heroes who magically transform from child form to an adult shape!)
<ul>
<li>If not, what triggers that change? Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, a magic word, or your own free will?</li>
<li>How do you get along with adult heroes? Do you look up to them as role models? Do they usually talk down to you?</li>
<li>In what ways are you less mature than the average hero?</li>
<li>In what ways are you more mature than the average hero?</li>
<li>Were you <em>always</em> a hero? How did you become one? Why did you become one?</li>
<li>Do you have any other friends your age, or do you just associate with adult heroes?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people?
<ul>
<li>Are you an artist at heart, a scientist, a poet, a doctor, a pilot?</li>
<li>What would push you over that edge, and how have you avoided going over it so far?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="skills-15">Skills</h4>
<p>You have the <strong>Explorer</strong> skill, plus two additional skills of your choice.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a roll that uses one of your skills, add 1 extra die. If you have more than one skill that could apply to a roll, add 1 extra die for each applicable skill.</p>
<h4 id="power-words-17">Power Words</h4>
<p>You can use your Power Words in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a <strong>Power Display</strong>, costing no Might</li>
<li>As a <strong>Stunt</strong>, costing 1 Might for each Word beyond the first</li>
<li>As a <strong>Power Combo</strong>, costing 1 Might and letting others join in</li>
<li>Joining a <strong>Power Combo</strong>, costing 1 Might.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use a Power Word, it goes on cooldown until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can’t use it until it is off cooldown.</p>
<h5 id="core-power-words-15">Core Power Words</h5>
<p>Your Core Power Words are <strong>Does</strong> <strong>Whatever</strong> and <strong>Can</strong>. You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo, 2 Might to add two, and 3 Might to add all three.</p>

<h4 class="class" id="totem-abilities-2">Totem Abilities</h4>
<p>Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class. Your Totem Abilities show your increasing distance from humanity. Each ability can be chosen only once.</p>
<h5 id="prime-ability-15">Prime Ability</h5>
<p>Your hero has the <strong>Force of Nature</strong> Prime ability common to all Totems.</p>
<div class="ability-list prime">
<dl>
<dt>Does Whatever a Totem Can</dt>
<dd><p>When you use your Core or Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt or Combo roll, add 2 dice to as if you had a skill or fighting style that applied to such a use.</p>
</dd>

</div>
<h5 id="volume-1-abilities-15">Volume 1 Abilities</h5>
<p>At the start of Volume 1, choose two abilities from this list.</p>
<div class="ability-list v1">
<dl>
<dt>Animal Partner</dt>
<dd><p><em>Prequisite: You can’t have the <strong>Alien Totem</strong> class ability.</em> You have an unusually intelligent pet or companion that accompanies you on your heroic adventures. This partner has three Core Power Words – one matching your Totem Nature Power Word, and two others from the Totem Personal Power Words List – that you can use for free without spending Might, each once per Hero Phase. Your animal partner’s Health and Might equal the Volume.</p>
<p>Choose one Skill possessed by your Animal Partner, and a Fighting Style. You can use that skill or Fighting Style whenever your Animal Partner is present during a Crisis.</p>
<p>During any Hero Phase, either your hero can make a move or your animal partner can make a move – not both.</p>
<p><em>Prerequisite: The <strong>Mystic Totem</strong> class ability.</em> If your animal partner is ever killed, they return to life at the end of the next Crisis Countdown, and join you as soon as they can.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Alien Totem</dt>
<dd><p>You are not connected to normal earth creatures, but alien versions of them. All of your abilities and power words work with similar creatures, no matter what worlds they originate from.</p>
<p>In addition, add <strong>Alien</strong> as a Core Power Word.</p>
</dd>
<dt>How Do You Do Fellow Animals?</dt>
<dd><p><em>Prequisite: You can’t have the <strong>Alien Totem</strong> class ability.</em> You can automatically communicate with any creatures matching your Totem Nature Power Word. They might not fully understand who you are and what you want from them, but you can audibly speak back and forth, and get information or possibly assistance from them, as if you were all sharing a common language.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mystic Totem</dt>
<dd><p>Your link to your nature totem is a result of mystical means, not technological a strictly scientific process. You gain the Mystic skill. Whenever you choose a Personal Power Word, you can choose from the Mage Class Personal Power Words List or the Divine Class Personal Power Words List.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Summon Swarm</dt>
<dd><p><em>Prequisite: You can’t have the <strong>Alien Totem</strong> class ability.</em> As a move during the Hero Phase, you can spend 1 Might to call up a swarm of normal creatures of the same type as your Totem Nature Power Word. These arrive at the start of the next Crisis Phase, and the scene gains your Totem Nature Power Word as a scene power word until the end of the crisis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Unkillable</dt>
<dd><p>You get knocked down but you get up again. They’re never gonna keep you down. Regain 1 Health at the start of the Hero Phase if you have 0 Health.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Unbeatable</dt>
<dd><p>Your powers cause people to under-estimate you and you actually punch can punch far above your normal weight class. Whenever you have one or more companions of the same type as your Totem Nature Power Word present – including from the <em>Animal Companion</em> or <em>Summon Swarm</em> class abilities – add 1 to the Effectiveness of any roll you make to advance any goal.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Variable Totem</dt>
<dd><p>At the start of the Hero Phase, you can change your Totem Nature Core Power Word to any other power word on the Totem Nature Core Power Words List. All of your abilities use the new Totem Nature until the start of the next Crisis Phase.</p>

<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>How do you look different from normal humans?
<ul>
<li>How much larger (or smaller) are you than other people?</li>
<li>What color is your skin, and what does it feel and look like?</li>
<li>What kind of strange appearance do you have that makes the ignorant assume you’re just an animalistic brute?</li>
<li>What does your voice sound like, and what kind of vocabulary do you employ?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are you <em>always</em> a kid?<br />
(If not, then you may want to consider playing your hero as <a href="#toc-multi-class">Multi-Class Hero</a> – this is appropriate for heroes who magically transform from child form to an adult shape!)
<ul>
<li>If not, what triggers that change? Is it an emotional state, a substance, a situation, a magic word, or your own free will?</li>
<li>How do you get along with adult heroes? Do you look up to them as role models? Do they usually talk down to you?</li>
<li>In what ways are you less mature than the average hero?</li>
<li>In what ways are you more mature than the average hero?</li>
<li>Were you <em>always</em> a hero? How did you become one? Why did you become one?</li>
<li>Do you have any other friends your age, or do you just associate with adult heroes?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What kind of interests do you have that surprise other people?
<ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I know secrets about you that you don’t even know yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psychics are masters of mind powers, able to communicate with others and link minds together.</p>
<p>Their powers are often purely mental without a physical manifestation; a duel between two Psychics could take place in the middle of a crowded restaurant with no one any the wiser.</p>
<p>If normal people knew that a Psychic was among them – and could potentially access their innermost thoughts and desires! – they would react with fear and hostility. Some Psychics will pose as some other type of hero to avoid such prejudices … even as they admit such biases might not be entirely unwarranted.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-wheelman">Playing a Wheelman</h4>
<p>Your Psychic hero is likely the lynchpin of the team, although not necessarily the leader. This is a passive ability, though – unless you choose otherwise, everyone’s connected when you’re present – so look for ways to use your own Power Words, Skills, and Abilities in creative and original ways.</p>
<section id="no-ethical-mind-control-under-capitalism-1" class="soapbox">
<h4>No Ethical Mind Control Under Capitalism</h4>
<p>Many comic books and roleplaying games will gloss over it, but I’ll state it directly: nearly any use of mind control powers represents gross violations of another person’s autonomy and consent.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you can’t <em>ever</em> do that in an Issue of <span class="gamename"></span>, but it means that you have to be careful and safe by checking in with the other players and the Editor – because your Psychic hero is probably doing something that’s quite horrific if you’re using mind control.</p>
<p>During Issue 0 or the start of an Issue, you should ask the other players and the Editor about whether they view reading someone’s mind without consent as the same kind of violation. Are surface thoughts fine, but deep memories not? You <em>need</em> to have these kinds of talks, as a group, before it comes up in play.</p>
</section>
<h4 id="questions-17">Questions</h4>
<p>As you create your Psychic hero, answer any or all of these questions.</p>
<div class="questions">
<ul>
<li>How do you come by these amazing mental powers?
<ul>
<li>What kind of training or education did you undertake to master them?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are there obvious signs to your powers, such as an enlarged forehead, glowing eyes, or a visible crackle of power – or are they completely invisible and undetectable?</li>
<li>What limits have you imposed on your own power due to ethical and moral concerns?
<ul>
<li>What type of actions won’t you take, and what would push you to actually commit those acts?</li>
<li>What makes you a <em>hero</em> and not a mind-powered villain, looting others’ skulls with impunity?</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="toc-power-displays">Power Displays</h3>
<div class="power-chart power-display">
<p><span class="power-word first any free"></span></p>
</div>
<p>When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word and explain how you’re using that power.</p>
<p>A Power Display doesn’t cost any Might points, and has two effects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You can add one die to a relevant roll</li>
<li>You can explain how your hero is able make a roll</li>
</ol>
<p>After you use a Power Word in a Power Display, it goes on Cooldown until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can’t use it until then.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to the skies to throw a punch.</p>
<p>If you don’t have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.</p>

<h3 id="toc-power-stunts">Power Stunts</h3>
<div class="power-chart power-stunt">
<p><span class="power-word first any free"></span> <span class="power-word any"></span></p>
</div>
<p>A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together. In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.</p>
<p>When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you’re hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory effects.</p>
<p>After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an appropriate roll for your Power Stunt – either to increase the Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an additional die to the dice pool for each Power Word.</p>
<p>You don’t have to come up with your Power Stunts beforehand; instead, you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.</p>
<p>After you use a Power Word in a Power Stunt, it goes on Cooldown until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can’t use it until then.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase “Flight Speed”. Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt means that when you make a roll – such as rolling your Adventure Approach to Outwit a foe – increases the number of dice in your pool by 2 dice.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc-power-combos">Power Combos</h3>

</div>
<p>A <strong>Power Combo</strong> is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work together, with their powers combined.</p>
<p>To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they’d like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you’re trying to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.</p>
<p>You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long as you can come up with an explanation of how they’re helping.</p>
<p>The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, and they’re called the initiating hero for that Combo.</p>
<p>A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt – the player of the initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them, spending 1 point of Might and increasing the number of dice of their next roll by 2 Success.</p>
<p>The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which adds a die to the dice pool.</p>
<p>Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one of their Core Power Words as a <em>third</em> (or fourth) Power Word in the Combo.</p>
<p>After you use a Power Word in a Power Combo – either as the initiating hero or as a contributing hero – it goes on Cooldown until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can’t use it until then.</p>

<p>Any encounter requiring your hero’s unique superheroic talents and powers is known as a <strong>Crisis.</strong> A Crisis could be anything from a natural disaster to a runaway train; from a group of normal criminals to one or more super-powered villains.</p>
<p>There isn’t a separate game system for combats and fights; those use the same system as any other Crisis.</p>
<p>Each Crisis is rated in four <strong>Goals</strong> that describe how the heroes could tackle that Crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smash</strong> - defeating the Crisis through physical damage</li>
<li><strong>Outwit</strong> - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis</li>
<li><strong>Allay</strong> - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis</li>
<li><strong>Rescue</strong> - save people or property endangered by the Crisis</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-countdown">Countdown to Crisis</h3>
<p>A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need to present at the start of a Crisis.</p>

<p>When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving a Crisis.</p>
<p>If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using an Approach related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for their heroes.</p>
<p>If your hero is <em>not</em> on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it’s being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-start">Starting a Crisis</h3>
<p>Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, it’s time to start dealing with the Crisis.</p>
<p>Instead of having an initiative order like many games of this type, there are two phases that alternate back and forth: the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase.</p>
<p>The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is the Hero Phase.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-hero">Hero Phase</h3>
<p>The heroes can each take one move during the Hero Phase, one at a time, in any order they like.</p>
<p>While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially two types of move you can make: Advance a Goal or Contribute to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<p>If your hero is <em>not</em> present, you can use the Timely Arrival move.</p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-advance">Advance a Goal</h4>
<p>When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the Crisis. There are four different ways of doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smash</strong> - defeating the Crisis through physical damage</li>
<li><strong>Outwit</strong> - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis</li>
<li><strong>Allay</strong> - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis</li>
<li><strong>Rescue</strong> - save people or property endangered by the Crisis</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to advance it once. You don’t need to roll all these successes at once; you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too.</p>
<p>Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, in any combination, the Crisis ends.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-contribute">Contribute to the Teamwork Pool</h4>
<p>When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything you can think of that might give your team an edge.</p>
<p>You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes.</p>
<p>When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h4 id="toc-crisis-hero-moves">Hero Moves</h4>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h5 id="toc-crisis-hero-moves-power">Power Moves</h5>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h5 id="toc-crisis-hero-moves-join">Joining a Power Combo</h5>
<p><strong>need to clarify: it doesn’t cost an action, but you can use each power word only once per phase</strong></p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h5 id="toc-crisis-hero-moves-fighting">Fighting Moves</h5>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h5 id="toc-crisis-hero-moves-skill">Skill Moves</h5>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h5 id="toc-crisis-hero-moves-other">Other Moves</h5>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h5 id="toc-crisis-timely">Timely Arrival</h5>
<p>When you use the Timely Arrival move, spend 5 successes from the Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current Hero Phase.</p>
<p>You can’t make any other moves that turn, but you <em>can</em> describe your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<p>The cost of the Timely Arrival move decreases by 1 success after every Crisis Phase.</p>
<h5 id="toc-crisis-alert">General Alert</h5>
<p>If two or more heroes aren’t present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at the scene can use their move to sound a General Alert and call for help. The cost of a General Alert is 1 success from the Teamwork Pool per hero called.</p>
<p>The heroes arrive at the start of the <em>next</em> Hero Phase, and can act normally during that Phase. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike a Timely Arrival, they don’t roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-crisis">Crisis Phase</h3>
<p>Once every hero has made a move, then it’s time for the Editor to make moves for the Crisis.</p>
<p>Every Crisis has a set number of moves per Crisis Phase. As a rule, the more moves a Crisis gets per Phase, the more difficult it is. If the Crisis has the same number of moves as the hero team, it will be very challenging.</p>
<p>The Editor chooses moves from the Crisis’s list of moves. Every move has a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes from the Teamwork Pool, they defend against that move and nothing happens.</p>
<p>If there aren’t enough successes in the pool to defend against the move, or if the heroes decide not to counter the move, then the move happens and the heroes face the consequences.</p>
<p>Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting the heroes’ ability to use a certain type of roll or move on their next turn, or innocents being endangered.</p>
<p>Once the Editor has taken enough Crisis moves, it’s time to go back to the heroes.</p>
<h3 id="toc-crisis-post">Post-Crisis</h3>
<p><span class="lorem"></span></p>
<p>For example, <span class="lorem"></span></p>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-advancements">Advancements</h2>
<p>Advancements are how you reflect your hero’s growth over the course of a Volume and Series.</p>
<p>After each Storyline concludes, choose one Advancement from the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase your Health by 1.</li>
<li>Increase your Might by 1.</li>
<li>Add one Skill; you can only choose this Advancement once per volume.</li>
<li>Add one Power Word from any class; you can only choose this Advancement once per volume.</li>
<li>Add one Fighting Style; you can only choose this Advancement once per volume.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spotlight-hero">Spotlight Hero</h3>
<p>If you had the Spotlight for that Storyline, increase any one Approach by 1. This is in addition to the normal Advancement for the end of a Storyline.</p>
<h3 id="changes">Changes</h3>
<p>Optionally, you could can make any or all of these changes to your hero:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change one of your Ideals to any other word.</li>
<li>Change your Opportunity if you haven’t already completed your Storyline.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="volume-advancements">Volume Advancements</h3>
<p>At the end of each Volume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a new Class ability from the new Volume or a previous Volume.</li>
<li>Create a new Opportunity for the new Volume.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changes-1">Changes</h4>
<p>In additional, you can choose one or more of the following changes to your hero:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch one of your Personal Power Words for another from your class.</li>
<li>Switch your Fighting Style to any other Fighting Style.</li>
<li>Switch one of your Skill choices for another Skill.</li>
<li>Change your Nova Words to any other two words.</li>
<li>Choose a new Costume, Symbol, or Hero Name.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="experienced-heroes">Experienced Heroes</h3>
<p>If you’re creating a new hero for an ongoing Series, you don’t start at Volume One – instead, your hero starts at the same Volume as everyone else.</p>
<h4 id="class-abilities">Class Abilities</h4>
<p>You start with the Class Ability from your class, and one Class Ability per Volume, of that Volume or lower.</p>
<h4 id="advancements">Advancements</h4>
<p>You get a number of Advancements equal to the number of other Heroes for each previous Volume. You can’t add more Skills, Personal Power Words, or Fighting Styles than the number of completed Volumes.</p>
<h2 class="breakbefore" id="toc-setting">The Official Handbook of the Cosmic Legends Universe</h2>
<p>The follow section offers a default setting for <span class="gamename"></span>, although you certainly don’t have to use it to play this game!</p>
<p>Our assumption is that you’ll use <span class="gamename"></span> to tell stories set in either a superhero universe of your own devising, or an existing universe from comics, television, novels, or movies.</p>
<p>But you might not – especially if you’re running a One-Shot, or if you just want to get start quickly. In that case, you’re definitely welcome to use the Cosmic Legends Universe (CLU) however you wish.</p>
<p>What follows is a faux-encyclopedia for the CLU, in the style of similar handbooks created by major comics publishers. Complete game stats are provided for the ten example characters pictured in the class writeups earlier in this book.</p>
<h3 id="toc-setting-era">Which Era?</h3>
<p>A few of the following entries reference a specific time period or year. There are several ways you can handle such dates:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Set Your Game in 1985</dt>
<dd><p><span class="gamename"></span> isn’t necessarily mean to be period-piece game, but there’s nothing that says you can’t play it that way.</p>
<p>Any date in the Bronze Age of comics works, but 1985 is a nice round number that you can use as the “current year.”</p>
<p>If you choose this approach, just accept all dates as written.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Adjust the Timeline</dt>
<dd><p>There aren’t any fixed points in time in the CLU timeline.</p>
<p>If you want Titan to arrive on Earth in 2013 or N.O.V.A. Labs to be a late-90s dotcom startup, that’s perfectly fine!</p>
<p>Cross out the years – figuratively or literally – and write in the new ones. It’s your Series!</p>
</dd>
<dt>Assume Comic Book Time</dt>
<dd><p>Everyone knows that characters in superhero comic books don’t age like the rest of us.</p>
<p>If you take this approach, you assume that all exact dates refer to hypothetical publishing dates of non-existent comics, but the real dates follow a sliding timeline.</p>
<p>Titan arrived on Earth 29 years ago, the Cosmic Legends formed 22 years ago, and Technopolis Academy was created 5 years ago.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Create a Modern Age</dt>
<dd><p>If you want to leave the dates where they are <em>and</em> still play in the 2020s (or whenever you’re reading <span class="gamename"></span>), you can!</p>
<p>Assume that everything described here happened up until 1985 or so, and that the last 35 or 40 years of CLU history haven’t been recorded.</p>
<p>You get to make up whatever happens during that time period, and the heroes and villains active in current times will probably be very different from those listed here – for example, Lin Montgomery would be over 50; is there a Vespa 3.0 active?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Don’t Sweat It.</dt>
<dd><p>This option is basically saying that you don’t worry that much about exact dates; it’s just not that important in your Series.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with just ignoring dates entirely.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Who decides which option to use? Ideally this would be part of a Session 0 discussion, and if an option requires work – such as making up several decades of superhero history – that should be split among the players and not dumped <em>solely</em> on the Editor.</p>
<p>That said, it’s also possible for the Editor to propose an era when pitching the game to the other players. You could even set your Series in a “historical” period in the CLU, such as the mid-1960s heyday of the Silver Age Cosmic Legends.</p>
<h3 id="toc-setting-customize">Customizing the Setting</h3>
<p>Although we do provide enough of a framework for you to get started, the CLU isn’t a fully realized superhero universe.</p>
<p>This is deliberate – because <em>your heroes</em> are the stars of the story in your Series, not whatever lore we wrote when putting <span class="gamename"></span> together.</p>
<p>There aren’t any other superhero teams listed – to give you room to insert your own.</p>
<p>The current state of the Cosmic Legends team isn’t detailed – so that your hero team can establish themselves as Earth’s mightiest heroes. Are you allies or are you rivals?</p>
<p>If you want to take out some of the hokier parts of the Bronze Age-style setting, feel free – you can edit away anything you want in your Series. You don’t even have to have the Cosmic Legends in the Cosmic Legends universe. What if they never formed?</p>
<h3 id="toc-setting-clotu">Playing as the Cosmic Legends</h3>
<p>Another approach is to just play the <strong>Cosmic Legends of the Universe</strong> team themselves.</p>
<p>There are complete stats for each “current” and “reserve” member – and you can download filled-out hero sheets from the <span class="gamename"></span> site at <a href="https://spindrift.games/clotu">spindrift.games/clotu</a>. This is good for One-Shots or even prequel stories.</p>
<p>If you want to make up your own heroes, they could be the <strong>All-Different New Cosmic Legends</strong> – nearly every superhero team in comic books had a point where their roster underwent major change.</p>
<p>Retire or kill off the lore CLotU members, or keep them as mentors and reserve members – just remember your new heroes are the stars.</p>
<p>And there’s nothing stopping you from combining these – some players using the “established” CLotU members, while others make “All-Different” new heroes.</p>
<h4 id="toc-setting-jloa">The Junior Legends of America</h4>
<p>If you want to play in the Cosmic Legends universe as younger heroes, the <strong>Junior Legends of America</strong> are an official auxillary of the CLotU comprised of teen heroes, students at Technopolis Academy, and former sidekicks.</p>
<p>Unlike the “current” CLotU members, JLoAers don’t receive a full writeup and some are just mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>To reflect the younger age of JLoA members compared to adult superheroes, you can use any or all of these optional rules:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Reduced Skills</dt>
<dd><p>Young heroes likely don’t have professional jobs or experience doing much beyond going to school.</p>
<p>To reflect this, replace two of the <strong>Skills</strong> you’d choose with <strong>Academic</strong> instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Undeveloped Powers</dt>
<dd><p>While younger heroes might have the same amount of raw power as their older counterparts, they may lack experience in use those powers in creative ways.</p>
<p>You can reflect this by picking two fewer <strong>Personal Power Words</strong> when you create your hero.</p>
</dd>
<dt>No Crisis Training</dt>
<dd><p>Every new hero gets a choice of one Fighting Style that reflects their strategies in a Crisis. But younger heroes may still be learning that – it’s one of the primary non-academic topics at Technopolis Academy.</p>
<p>Therefore, no young heroes start off knowing a <strong>Fighting Style</strong>, with the exception of a young Knight – a Squire? – who gets one.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These optional rules are <em>only</em> intended for a Series that focuses exclusively on younger heroes.</p>
<p>If you’re playing a young hero in a Series with adult heroes, <em>don’t</em> use the rules above – create your hero normally, with the same rules used by everyone else.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can use these optional rules if you’re playing young heroes of your own creation, either in the Cosmic Legends or elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong></p>
<p>Martin McCord never wanted to be the world’s first One-Officer-Police-Force, but a near-fatal shootout took that choice away from him. Seconds away from dying, his injured brain was transplanted into the ADAM-42 android body, saving his life and trapping him in a metal form physically superior to, and distinctively less functional than, his original human body.</p>
<p>As fate would have it … that was the time that Thompson’s hubris was proven a false vanity. The reactor raged out of control as dangerous energies washed over her laboratory and the rest of Technopolis.</p>
<p>With Delphine unconscious and dying from radiation poisoning, only quick thinking by Del managed to halt the out-of-control reaction – at the cost of his life. The young boy was completely disintegrated.</p>
<p>Or so everyone believed. Over the next few weeks, Del reformed his body from pure nuclear energy. He regained consciousness to find his mother had survived – but had likewise been changed by the overloaded reactor. Calling herself Neutrino, she fled police custody and soon joined the newly-forming Villains, Inc.</p>
<p>Del was taken in by his mother’s former lab partner, Hazel Montgomery, the original Vespa. Together with Montgomery’s child Lin – the sidekick hero Bug – Del became one of the first two students at Technopolis Academy and a founding member of the Junior Legends of America.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Del’s natural state of being is a humanoid form composed of supercharged plasma. He can use this energy as destructive blasts, as an energy-backed “nuke punch!”, and as a force bubble to absorb energy.</p>
<p>With concentration – and as a result of years of practice – he can dampen his nuclear energies and assume a human shape, becoming the young man he would have been had his mother’s pride not cost them both dearly.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong> As a child, Sienna MacGowan heard legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann from her grandmother, and she claimed the Celtic gods even spoke to her in her dreams.</p>
<p>When she grew older, Sienna’s dreams faded and she no longer believed in the mythological aspects of Celtic fables. Instead, she resolved to prove that the Tuatha Dé Danann were historical beings as mortal as anyone else.</p>
<p>Armed with an archaeology degree, Sienna was working late at a digsite outside the village of Skryne, when a voice called out to her, asking why she had forgotten her dreams. The experience repeated each night, although none save her heard the voice.</p>
<p>Finding no logical explanation for the phenomenon, Sienna replied to the voice and asked who was speaking. The goddess Brigit appeared before Sienna, told her she was the Champion of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and gifted her with power.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> When Sienna speaks the magic words, <em>Claidheamh Soluis</em>, she is transformed into the superhumanly powerful Champion, Brigantia.

<p><strong>History:</strong> Del Thompson grew up in the shadow of brilliance – his mother and namesake, Delphine Thompson, was one of the most gifted physicists of her generation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her genius led her to take dangerous risks, including going online with an experimental cold fusion reactor before all the appropriate safeties were online. “You only need those when things go wrong,” Delphine explained to her son, then ten years old. “And I never get things wrong.”</p>
<p>As fate would have it … that was the time that Thompson’s hubris was proven a false vanity. The reactor raged out of control as dangerous energies washed over her laboratory and the rest of Technopolis.</p>
<p>With Delphine unconscious and dying from radiation poisoning, only quick thinking by Del managed to halt the out-of-control reaction – at the cost of his life. The young boy was completely disintegrated.</p>
<p>Or so everyone believed. Over the next few weeks, Del reformed his body from pure nuclear energy. He regained consciousness to find his mother had survived – but had likewise been changed by the overloaded reactor. Calling herself Neutrino, she fled police custody and soon joined the newly-forming Villains, Inc.</p>
<p>Del was taken in by his mother’s former lab partner, Hazel Montgomery, the original Vespa. Together with Montgomery’s child Lin – the sidekick hero Bug – Del became one of the first two students at Technopolis Academy and a founding member of the Junior Legends of America.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Del’s natural state of being is a humanoid form composed of supercharged plasma. He can use this energy as destructive blasts, as an energy-backed “nuke punch!”, and as a force bubble to absorb energy.</p>
<p>With concentration – and as a result of years of practice – he can dampen his nuclear energies and assume a human shape, becoming the young man he would have been had his mother’s pride not cost them both dearly.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong> Percival Pellinore, the Grailknight, is <em>the</em> Percival of myth – member of Arthur’s Round Table, son of Pellinore, questing knight of the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>Although Percival is reluctant to speak of his past, he has told a few that he swore an oath to find and recover the Chalice of the Last Supper, and that he would never rest until he had fulfilled said oath.</p>
<p>Either his unflagging devotion to his vow or the divine nature of his mission have kept him alive, and no older than middle aged, for centuries. Percival’s legend weaves in and out of history – surfacing in one war only to disappear for a century after it and reappearing around the world.</p>
<p>In 1963, over 50 years since his last appearance, Percival joined with other heroes of the time to repell Xana Mega’s Fomorian invasion. Percival’s offhand mention of the Table Round led to the formation of these heroes as a team, the Cosmic Legends of the Universe.</p>
<p>With a tendency to vanish for weeks or years at a time, Percival is at best a part-time member of the Cosmic Legends, although whenever evil is ascendent, he is an implaccable foe and resourceful ally.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Sir Percival has only one confirmed power: immortality. Due to his vows, he’s unable to die until he completes his quest and finds the Grail.</p>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Although Percival is familiar with modern weaponry, he prefers to use a crossbow with specially prepared bolts that range from explosive tips to stun charges.</p>
<p>His chainmail is a gift from the Aos Sí and is completely unbreakable, while his sword, Sequence, is a sister blade to Excalibur from Arthur’s arsenal.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong> The Head Librarian has no idea who he is or where he is from. He awoke in a field outside of Peshawar, Pakistan, as an adult with no memory of his prior life – but the ability to understand and speak every language he encountered. No database on Earth – digital or analog – contains any record of the man.</p>
<p>He was instrumental in helping the Cosmic Legends defeat Glytch’s attempts to digitize Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and accepted an invitation to join the team.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> All information is an open book to the Head Librarian, whether in printed form, digital, or mental. He can instantly read any book by touching it, and his psychic powers let him browse through the thoughts and memories of others as easily as looking up a definition in a dictionary.</p>
<p>Although he can absorb information at tremendous speeds, his memory retention is not superhuman. The Librarian can hold only a few books in memory at once before the information starts to fade. For this reason, he brings reference materials with him in the field – “If I don’t know the answer, I can look it up!” is his motto.</p>
<p>In addition to his purely mental powers, the Head Librarian’s rudimentally telekinetic powers let him lift books off the ground and move them about.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong> Jack Dee would really rather be doing anything else right now, instead of saving the world from the latest mystical threat.</p>
<p>The scion of a long line of magical champions, Jack planned to be a lawyer – not a superhero. Corporate law is just so much more lucrative than wizardly troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Even as his mother Maddie founded the Cosmic Legends of the Universe as Miss Magister, Jack pursued other interests – even serving as the Cosmic Legends’ attorney at times.</p>
<p>When Maddie retired from the Cosmic Legends, her brother Johnny Dee – Jack’s uncle – assumed her position as the Master Magister. Johnny’s tenure as Master Magister was cut short by the duplicity of Sequana, who stole his power before taking his life.</p>
<p>Maddie and Jack worked together to avenge Johnny, but the strain was too much for the elder Dee; with her dying breath, she bequeathed her power and position to Jack, naming him as the new Master Magister. He currently serves as a reserve member of the Cosmic Legends, joining as a specialist on missions involving the occult and supernatural.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> As the Master Magister, Jack Dee’s magical powers are limited only by his imagination and his force of will. He can conjure shields, travel in astral form, cloud the senses of the weak-willed, and call upon the strength of his ancestral line to banish evil.</p>
<p>He’s also a fairly decent attorney.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong> For most Earthlings, Obsidius was the first Vulcanor they’d ever heard of; the inhabitants of the Volcano Isles kept themselves isolated for centuries from the primative outside world.</p>
<p>The oldest child of King Tachylus and Queen Limuo, Obsidius was raised to be the heir to the advanced Vulcanor civilization. From an early age, he trained with weapons and studied statecraft and the sciences.</p>
<p>While just a young man, Tachylus sent Obsidius as an emissary, first to meet Titan and then to the outside world in general. Shortly after the Cosmic Legends were created, he joined as their first non-founding member.</p>
<p>Obsidius’s recklessness as a young man led to several diplomatic incidents with the outside world, including a tense but brief cold war with New Zealand.</p>
<p>The ensuing decades have mellowed the crown prince’s temper, and he’s regarded as an elder statesman in the superhero community – to his amusement, as 75 years of age is still considered young by Vulcanor standards.</p>
<p>King Tachylus, on the other hand, is no longer a young monarch and is showing his age. Obsidius’s mother, Limuo, has renounced her title and separated from Tachylus, while their younger child, Igneia, was exiled for attempting to murder the rest of the Royal Family.</p>
<p>These have put additional stresses on Obsidius to find a spouse and produce a future successor, if just to prevent Vulcanor from descending into a civil war between his many squabbling cousins were something to happen to the king and prince.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Like all Vulcanors, Obsidius is superhumanly strong, able to lift several tons and resist small-arms fire with his stony skin. He’s also completely impervious to heat of any kind.</p>
<p>Obsidius’s rank as the Crown Prince gives him limited control over rock and earth, although he has done little to actively develop those abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Obsidius Rex’s primary weapon is the Lavablade, a greatsword formed of volcanic steel. In the past he has wielded the Ring of Fire as his symbol of rank, but it was destroyed by the Man in Black in 2003.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong> Kelly Liang always loved the sea; while a high school student in Hawai’i she took a job as a lifeguard, even though her family was wealthy enough that she didn’t <em>need</em> to work.</p>
<p>While working that very job, Kelly was stung by a mutated jellyfish in the process of saving a drowning woman. She managed to make it safely back to shore before from the strange toxins in her blood.</p>
<p>Kelly lay in a coma for three weeks, while her parents saw that she received the best care that money could buy – including an experimental treatment that brought her back to consciousness.</p>
<p>Although she was awake, the experience had left her weakened and barely able to move. Giving up her beloved surfing hobby, Kelly threw herself into the study of biochemistry and marine biology, eventually becoming a professor.</p>
<p>Years after her life-changing accident, Kelly managed to a synthesize a cure for the poisons that ravaged her body – and also found a strange side effect had given her control over water!</p>
<p>Dubbing herself Riptide, Liang became a superhero and eventually was invited to join the Cosmic Legends. She still teaches marine biology at the university; Kelly’s identity as Riptide is an open secret among most Hawai’ians.</p>
<p>But as Riptide is the most prominent and popular superhero of Hawai’i, the people of the islands are happy to maintain the polite fiction that there’s no connection between Professor Liang and the Hero of Hilo.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Riptide has complete telekinetic control over liquid water, with limited control over ice and water vapor. She can condense atmospheric water to liquid form, and can instantly melt or evaporate solid ice.</p>
<p>She can propel herself at speeds up to 100 m.p.h. underwater or on the surface of a body of water, and 50 m.p.h. over land.</p>

<p>The people of Saturn’s moon Titan are not native to the Solar System; according to their oldest tales, they were taken from their home planet by a civilization known as the Visitors, were subjected to scientific experiments, and were eventually abandoned on Titan.</p>
<p>Titanians – known as <em>Ro’Tan’Okk</em> in their own language – have strong mental powers and communicate by telepathy as often as they use <em>Ro’Tan’Kesh</em>.</p>
<p>They are physically superior to humans, with most able to lift over 50 tons with minimal effort. Their only weakness is a strong reaction to being touched by salt water, which burns them and drains their energy.</p>
<p>There are four known genders among the Titanians; Earthlings are only familiar with the <em>nyrr-t’vor</em> gender thanks to the presence of Ty’Tonn To’Rezz on Earth. Titanian families are comprised of 3 or more spouses and their children.</p>
<p>The <em>Ro’Tan’Okk</em> have no concepts of war or crime; the closest thing to a military in Titanian society is the <em>Kyl’Sh’Tal</em> – the famed Sentinels of Saturn. Sentinels are astronomers tasked with constant vigilance – to watch the skies for the return of the Visitors.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong> Titan is widely acknowledged as the first public superhero and one of the primary leaders among the heroes.</p>
<p>Ty’Tonn To’Rezz’s story begins on Jarnsaxa, one of the smaller, outer moons of Saturn. There, Ty’Tonn and his spouses manned the massive telescopes and monitoring systems created by the Sentinels of Saturn.</p>
<p>When the remote sensory devices detected the approach of a Visitor fleet, Ty’Tonn was chosen to travel to <em>L’Shar’Ak</em>, capital of Titan, and present their findings to <em>Kyl’Sh’Tal</em> command.</p>
<p>According to the course computed by My’Tonn, Ty’s sibling, the Visitors would pass by just the outermost moons of Saturn and instead were on a direct path for <em>W’Ty’Dah’k</em>, the third planet from the sun: Earth.</p>
<p>Fearing the harm the Visitors could do to the primitive, just-barely-nuclear civilizations of <em>W’Ty’Dah’k</em>, Ty’Tonn urged the <em>Kyl’Sh’Tal</em> to intervene. Are they not the Sentinels for the entire solar system, Ty argued; should they not be concerned with the fate of all who are threatened by the Visitors?</p>
<p>The <em>Kyl’Sh’Tal</em> council debated for many hours but it soon became clear that they prioritized the survival of Titanian civilization over that of <em>W’Ty’Dah’k</em> – and even considered the potentially massive loss of human life to a net benefit to the people of Titan.</p>
<p>Outraged by their actions, Ty’Tonn returned to Jarnsaxa and plotted sedition within in their spouse cluster. Ty’ would head to <em>W’Ty’Dah’k</em> first, to be followed by the rest of the cluster once contact had been established with the Earthings.</p>
<p>Ty’Tonn To’Rezz arrived on Earth in October 1956 and made contact with the Americans’ Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats (A.L.E.R.T.). Becoming known on Earth as <em>Titan</em>, Ty’Tonn worked with A.L.E.R.T., Marquis Malign, Vespa and Obsidius to drive back the initial wave of Visitor landing craft and break their invasion.</p>
<p>Scorned by the other <em>Kyl’Sh’Tal</em> for disobedience, Ty’Tonn To’Rezz returned to family on Jarnsaxa, only to find that the monitoring outpost had been destroyed by retreating Visitor craft when the station’s cloaking screens failed under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>Following that tragedy, Ty’Tonn relocated permanently to the planet Earth, despite the sweltering heat, and went on to help found the Cosmic Legends of the Universe in September 1963. For while he used the name “Tom Torres” but has since discontinued the use of an alternate identity. Since the start of the 21 century, he has lived in Nova Scotia and has been granted honorary Canadian citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Titan is perhaps the most powerful individual on the planet. His Titanian strength lets him lift well over 100 tons, and he is able to project the cold frost of the Titanian sky from his eyes as energy beams. Flight, speed, and telepathy round out his vast array of alien powers – which are exceptional even for a Titanian.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>History:</strong> As a young girl, Hazel Montgomery showed a talent for technology that eventually brought her to the attention of A.L.E.R.T. who tasked her with analyzing and reverse-engineering Titanian science once Titan revealed himself to the world.</p>
<p>Eventually she became a field operative for A.L.E.R.T., using a suit of armor of her own creation. As Vespa, she was a founding member of the Cosmic Legends of the Universe; as Hazel Montgomery, she was a founding director of N.O.V.A. Labs.</p>
<p>Although gifted with science, Montgomery had worse luck when it came to interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Phineas Pann, her mentor, was revealed as the criminal mastermind behind T.R.E.L.A. Her “storybook romance” with Magnus, Marquis of Vadyvokia, fell apart shortly after the birth of their child Lin. Delphine Thompson, Hazel’s former partner at N.O.V.A., turned to a life of villainy as Neutrino. Lin seemingly took a criminal turn as the Hornette, although this was later revealed to be a ruse.</p>
<p>Montgomery had retired from active duty with the Cosmic Legends when she sacrificed her life to repel the Visitors’ Third Visitation. Her child Lin adopted the name Vespa 2.0 as an homage to the beloved heroine.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Hazel Montgomery had no super-powers, just her brilliant and creative mind.</p>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Hazel’s primary weapon was the Vespa armor, designed as rescue and recon gear for saving lives. Bulletproof and equipped with transparent insect wings, the Vespa armor served her well for decades, with constant upgrades of weaponry and sensors.</p>

<h5>Lin’s Gender</h5>
<p>As a non-binary character who uses they/them pronouns, Lin Montgomery could be viewed as slightly anachronistic if firm timelines are followed.</p>
<p>However, this is a bit of authorial license that I’m not going to lose any sleep over. Maybe the CLU is a slightly better world than our own in this regard.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>History:</strong> As the child of Hazel Montgomery, charter member of the Cosmic Legends of the Universe, and Marquis Malign, regarded by many as the greatest supervillain of history, Lin Montgomery carries the weight of a very heavy pedigree in the superhero world.</p>
<p>Conceived shortly after their parents wed in secret and before Malign’s coup propelled him to the throne of Vadyvokia, Lin grew up surrounded by the Cosmic Legends. To many, they were the archetypal “kid sidekick” as Bug the Binary Bantling.</p>
<p>Although their first suit of armor was wholly lacking in offensive systems, Lin made certain … <em>alterations</em> to the Bug armor, giving it capabilities beyond merely defensive uses.</p>
<p>Along with their foster brother Del Thompson, Lin formed the Junior Legends of America; the pair were also the first students at the newly chartered Technopolis Academy, and Lin its first graduate.</p>
<p>Once they had graduated, Lin was contacted by Magnus Malign, who seemingly convinced them to adopt a villainous persona as the Hornette and join Villains, Inc. Eventually this cooperation was revealed as a ruse that helped bring down VI, but it also led to Marquis Malign disowning them and swearing eternal enmity.</p>
<p>Lin was still operating as the Hornette and serving in the Cosmic Legends in their mother’s stead when the Third Vistation arrived on Earth and began to process the population of the planet for abduction to a distant star.</p>
<p>Only the alliance of the Cosmic Legends, the Junior Legends, and Marquis Malign’s forces was able repel the Visitors – and at the cost of Hazel Montgomery’s life.</p>
<p>Shaken by this loss, Lin changed their name to Vespa 2.0 and rededicated themself to fighting for justice.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Lin Montgomery has no powers; all of their abilities come from their armored suit. As the crown marquex of Vadyvokia, Lin may possess some sorcerous potential, but has never trained those.</p>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Vespa 2.0’s armored suit is an evolved version of their mother’s, with advanced microhydraulics and structural reinforcements that let them lift over 25 tons. A low-power forcefield surrounds the suit, reinforcing the flimsy-looking plasma wings that generate anti-grav lift.</p>
<p>In addition, Lin sometimes carries a gun that fires electrical and laser blasts, originally developed during her days as The Hornette.</p>

</div>
<p>The people of Vulcanor are an offshoot of humanity that was experimented on by the Visitors over 3,000 years ago; their skin was hardened to a shiny gloss and they were adapted to live in volcanic conditions. Slaying their Visitor enslavers and stealing a shuttle craft, they settled on an otherwise uninhabitable remote chain of islands in the south Pacific.</p>
<p>That distance allowed the Vulcanors time to disassemble and reverse-engineer many Visitor technologies, including a compass-scrambling magnetic field that cloaked their islands from the European colonialist powers.</p>
<p>With the arrival of Titan on Earth in 1956, King Tachylus decreed it was time to join the rest of the world and share – in limited amounts – their unique technologies. His son Obsidius was sent as an emissary and later joined the Cosmic Legends of the Universe.</p>
<p>Excessive heat and volcanic gasses prevent the Vulcanor Islands from becoming a vacation destination. While outsiders are welcomed and treated with respect, few non-Vulcanors have been Volcano City.</p>

<li><p>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.</p></li>
<li><p>The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="section-6-term-and-termination.">Section 6 – Term and Termination.</h3>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your rights under this License terminate automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(A), it reinstates:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or</p></li>
<li><p>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(B) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="section-7-other-terms-and-conditions.">Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</h3>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p></li>
<li><p>Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this License.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="section-8-interpretation.">Section 8 – Interpretation.</h3>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p></li>
