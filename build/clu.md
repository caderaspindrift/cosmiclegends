## Using Powers {#toc-power-use .breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}


### Power Displays {#toc-power-displays}

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-display} :::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word
and explain how you're using that power.

A Power Display doesn't cost any Might points, and has two effects:

1. You can add one die to a relevant roll
2. You can explain how your hero is able make a roll

After you use a Power Word in a Power Display, it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it
as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to 
the skies to throw a punch. 

If you don't have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your
Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby 
skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Power Stunts {#toc-power-stunts }

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-stunt} :::::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free} 
[]{.power-word .any} 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together.
In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.

When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words
and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you're
hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe
what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory
effects.

After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an
appropriate roll for your Power Stunt -- either to increase the
Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an
additional die to the dice pool for each Power Word.

You don't have to come up with your Power Stunts beforehand; instead,
you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your
creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.

After you use a Power Word in a Power Stunt, it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

:::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you
could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase
"Flight Speed". Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt
means that when you make a roll -- such as rolling your Adventure
Approach to Outwit a foe -- increases the number of dice in your pool
by 2 dice.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Power Combos {#toc-power-combos }

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-combo} :::::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free}

[]{.power-word .any .dashed}
[]{.plus .dashed .dotdotdot} 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A **Power Combo** is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work
together, with their powers combined. 

To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they'd
like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you're trying
to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are
taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.

You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long
as you can come up with an explanation of how they're helping.

The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, 
and they're called the initiating hero for that Combo.

A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt -- the player of the
initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them,
spending 1 point of Might and increasing the number of dice
of their next roll by 2 Success.

The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another
Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which adds a die to the
dice pool.

Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one 
of their Core Power Words as a *third* (or fourth) Power Word in 
the Combo.

After you use a Power Word in a Power Combo -- either as the
initiating hero or as a contributing hero -- it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

You can use one of your Core Power Words as a *third* Power Word 
in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, 
and adds another 1 die to the dice pool on your roll.

By spending yet 1 *more* Might point you can add your *other* 
Core Power Word as a *fourth* Power Word in a Power Stunt. 
Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 dice in the dice pool,
but also costs you 3 Might points.

Once you've checked all of your hero's Ideals, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Storyline.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words as the *second* Power
Word in a Stunt without spending any Might; likewise, you can add 
use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the 
Nova Power Word still increases the roll's dice pool by 1 die.

Using your *other* Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or
Power Combo requires spending 1 Might.

Each scene has up to 6 Scene Power Words, chosen by the Editor.

You can use one Scene Power Word as a second Power Word in a 
Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, 
but they still contribute 1 die to the dice pool.

Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, 
and it likewise increases the dice pool of that Combo.

Like other Power Words, every time a Scene Power Word is used in
a Display, Stunt, or Power, it goes on Cooldown until the start
of the next Hero Phase and can't be used again until then.
