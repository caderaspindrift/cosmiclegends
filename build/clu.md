## Ethos {#toc-ethos .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} revolves around the following three pillars:

### Self Expression

The Power Word system and Crisis system are intentionally built to 
give players freedom to engage with problems in their own style. 
[]{.gamename} lets you be yourself, and do things in your own way, 
without being left behind by your team.

### Teamwork

[]{.gamename} games is written to encourage the players to work 
together. Whether you're combining your powers to use Power Combos
or using your skills to overcome an opponent together, heroes in 
[]{.gamename} succeed or fail as a team.

### Difficult Choices

The Edge Success system is built so that you have the freedom 
to choose failure. The Crisis system is built so that you can 
choose to take big hits. Good things and bad things happen to
your hero, and both of these are in the your hands to choose. 
The Editor’s job is to give you those difficult choices.


:::::::::::::::: {.soapbox #soapbox-no-fascists } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
## No Fascists

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) or something.

## A Four-Color Bronze Age Superhero TTRPG {.breakbefore #toc-preface}

[]{.lorem}


### "Four-Color"

The term "four-color" refers to the printing process used
in comics that led to most heroes having bold, primary
colors for their uniforms, their bodies, their worlds.

One example is Superman's hair having *blue* overtones --
this was meant to display his hair as a lustrous black
but the capabilities time precluded that.

*Our* use of the term "four-color" doesn't refer to the 
print process for this game but instead to the general tone 
of late Silver Age and Bronze Age comics -- when primary-color 
superheroes of the '50s and '60s met the social issues of 
the '70s and '80s.


### The Super Friends

In case you didn't notice, this game is inspired by the 
[Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends)
cartoon show that was on the air from 1973 to 1985 -- also
the years yours truly was age 5 and 16. It's fair to say
the show influenced how I view comics and superheroes
in general.

The first season has this great opening monologue where the four 
heroes were "created from the cosmic legends of the universe!"

What on earth does *that* mean?  How exactly was *Bruce Wayne*
created from the __cosmic legends of the universe__?!
I've never figured that out, but it does make a great title
for this Bronze Age-inspired, four-color tabletop RPG.


### The Ages of Comics

American comics fans and scholars divide the history of 
comics into four loosely defined "ages": the Golden Age, the
Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Modern Age.

The Golden Age - 1938 to 1956

:   The Golden Age started with the introduction of Superman
    and the concept of superheroes in general.
    Many of the most well-known characters, such as Wonder Woman 
    and Captain America, were created during the Golden Age.
  
    Some comics in the Golden Age were simplistic fun, while others 
    featured dark themes, shocking gore, and vile villains.  A lot of 
    Nazis were punched in those comics, which is always a good thing.
  
    Unfortunately, racism and sexism often were major themes in Golden 
    Age comics; examples of anti-Asian hatred are all too easy to find.

The Silver Age - 1956 to circa 1970

:   The Silver Age began when DC Comics created new versions of the Flash, 
    Green Lantern, and others, then the Justice League of America. 
    Marvel responded by creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, 
    the Avengers, the Hulk, the X-Men, and more.
  
    The Silver Age also saw the creation of the Comics Code Authority,
    a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic
    over the content of comics.
  
    Superhero comics in the Silver Age followed a long list of 
    restrictions banning everything from "horror" and "gore" 
    to "vampires" and "cannibalism". Heroes always won, villains 
    always lost, and authority figures were portrayed with respect -- 
    at least, that's what the Comics Code demanded.

The Bronze Age - ca. 1970 to ca. 1985

:   The Bronze Age is less distinctly defined chronologically, but was 
    a time when comics went through changes: becoming more socially 
    relevant and less restrained by the CCA. More on that later.
  
The Modern Age - ca. 1985 to present

:   The current age of comics is usually dated to 
    DC's *Crisis on Infinite Earths* and Marvel's *Secret Wars*.

    Modern superhero comics often feature antiheroes, complex
    storylines, and mature themes. Many of the older characters
    were revamped to more contemporary versions.

    The CCA also withered away to nothing as the major publishers
    increasingly created comics without the CCA seal on the cover.
  

### The Bronze Age

[]{.lorem}


## Safety Tools {#toc-safety .breakbefore}

Safety tools are a way for players and Editors to communicate
and check-in **before**, **during**, and **after** a game in 
order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and to provide 
the right support when needed.

The key to safety tools is **communication and trust**. There needs 
to be open and respectful communication alongside a culture of 
trust for these to work.

Playing the []{.gamename} RPG should be enjoyable for everyone,
and to help make that happen, we recommend the following techniques.


### Before the Game

Before you even start playing an Issue of []{.gamename}, talk about 
what you want to see in the game -- and what you don't want to see.

If you're planning a long, open-ended Series, you may even want to 
devoted a whole session to this -- called an *Issue 0* in []{.gamename};
for shorter games you should at least touch on these topics.

#### Lines and Veils

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on content, things that the Editor or the 
players don’t want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means that the content might 
be in the game but not spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

#### Using the Comics Code {#toc-comics-code}

Don't worry, I promise the CCA isn't going to shut down your game. 

Despite how terrible 
the [Comics Code](http://cbldf.org/the-comics-code-of-1954/) was in 
reality -- and it had a *stifling* effect on freedom of expression 
in comics for decades -- it *does* give an interesting snapshot of 
the types of content that might show up in a Bronze Age superhero game.

The following questions are inspired by items in the Comics Code and
are intended to start conversations -- not end them! 

As you discuss these questions as a group, anyone should feel free to 
request a line or veil on these or any other subjects.

##### General Questions

::::::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Does good always triumph over evil? Does evil sometimes
  triumph over good?

- Is profanity from NPCs acceptable? From heroes?

- Should your game avoid depictions of alcohol use, drug
  use, or drug addiction?

- Do the villains eventually get what's coming to them, or do
  some get away with their crimes?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Forces of Law and Justice

::::::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Given the history of police violence, do you want to play that
  out in a roleplaying game?

- Do you even want to deal with the police at all in your games?

- Do you want to have Storylines about corrupt judges and a justice
  system that doesn't work?

- Are glamorous, alluring, or even sympathetic villains fine,
  or would you rather have black-and-white villainy?

- Do you want Nazis as villains in this game?

- Are the heroes criminals themselves and wanted by the authorities?
  If so, which authorities, and why?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Types of Crises

::::::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Are you okay with Storylines about the military and war?

- Are there certain natural disasters, such as brushfires or
  earthquakes, that you're not interested in playing out?

- Would you rather not have zombies, vampires, werewolves, or other
  types of mythological monsters in your game? 

- What about more mundane creatures like spiders or snakes?

- Are there other types of Crises you don't want to deal with?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Depictions of Awfulness

::::::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Are in-character bigotries such as ableism, racism, homophobia, 
  transphobia, or antisemitism acceptable from NPCs?

- Are they acceptable from heroes?

- What about slurs spoken by NPCs, and slurs spoken by heroes?

- Do you want to restrict descriptions of violence to abstract 
  summaries instead of the gory details?

- Are there certain types of violence that you would rather
  not see in the game, such as torture, knives or guns,
  or kidnapping? Violence against children? Against animals?

- Would you be bothered by villains using mind control or other
  mental violations? Are those okay for heroes to do?

- Is it acceptable to have an NPC or hero be a rape survivor as 
  part of their backstory, or should there be no references to 
  sexual assault at all?

- Can innocent bystanders be killed during a Crisis? What about
  named NPCs the players have become attached to?

- Should the villains be able kill heroes, or should that only
  happen as part of a Storyline chosen by a player?

- Can the heroes kill? What should the other heroes do if a hero 
  kills a villain?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Relationships

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Does romantic attraction factor into this game at all, or is
  it something you'd rather not see? 

- Is it okay to roleplay flirting between heroes and NPCs? 
  What about between heroes?

- Should love and romance problems such as infidelity or
  divorce be avoided? Should marriage?

- Is sexual innuendo between heroes and NPCs acceptable? What
  about among the heroes themselves?

- Do you want to fade to black long before sexual content
  such as nudity or kink enters the game, or are seduction 
  scenes okay to play out up to a certain point?

- How should queer issues be handled in the game? Should the
  NPCs be LGBTQIA+ friendly?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

###  During the Game {.colbefore}

When you get caught up in playing []{.gamename}, it can sometimes
be hard to gauge how everyone else is feeling. These tools can be
used while you're playing to make it easier to share.

#### Breaks

For Issues that run longer than 2 hours or Issues that have 
intense content, having a short built-in break is recommended 
to allow people to stay focused and process. Allow for 
discussion, bio breaks, or any other needs during this time.

As a general rule, the Editor should offer a break after a Crisis 
concludes. The players might not want one, in which case the
game continues.

#### Open Door

The **Open Door** is the assurance that someone can leave or take 
a break from the game for their own safety and well-being without 
being judged.  State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

#### Comic Page Change Tools {#toc-script-change}

During play, you can use **Comic Script Change Tools** to adjust 
play and content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards with the words written on them, typing the first letter of the 
move in the chat function of the video conference software or 
virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand signals. 

Before each Issue of []{.gamename}, Editors and players should
discuss how to use each of these tools.

**Retcon** can be used when something has happened in play 
that makes a participant uncomfortable.  When **Retcon** is 
used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to retcon...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a point before 
it happened, and play starts again.

**Later That Day, ...** can be used when a participant would like to 
skip past uncomfortable content or to the next part of the 
story for pacing.  When **Later** is used by tapping the card, 
typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud 
("I’d like to go to later that day..."), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

**Meanwhile, ...** can be used when everyone is ready to continue play, 
often after adjusting or discussing content. When **Meanwhile** 
used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or 
stating it out loud ("Meanwhile...?"), continue with play if 
everyone agrees they're ready.

**Continued Next Page** can be used when things are too intense, 
but you still want to continue playing the scene. When **Continued**
is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or 
stating it out loud ("I’d like to continue to the next page..."), 
you can take a break and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
**Continued**, you can use **Meanwhile**, **Retcon**, or **Later**.


### After the Game {.colbefore}

When you finish an Issue of []{.gamename}, it's important to look
back at the things you enjoyed the most and the things you didn't 
like as much.

#### Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over into post-game 
life. This can affect the enjoyment of the game, as well as 
out-of-game relationships between players and Editor if not 
worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game begins and ends, and being 
conscious of which feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

#### Stars and Wishes {#toc-stars-wishes}

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the session and communicate 
feedback in a positive and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed and loved 
about the game. This could include a particular moment of roleplay, 
a Crisis created by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular interactions 
between heroes, potential story moments and development, or 
anything else that could make the game even better in the future.

## Overview of Play {#toc-overview .breakbefore}

1. []{.gamename} is played as a series of **Storylines**, each
   taking up one or more game sessions, or **Issues**.

2. Before a new Storyline, the players decide who the **Spotlight**
   hero will be during that Storyline. 

3. The player with the Spotlight tells the Editor what **Opportunity**
   they'd like their hero to experience.

4. The Editor shapes a series of **Crises** that let the Spotlight hero
   work through that Opportunity.

5. Once each player has had the Spotlight to address their 
   hero's Opportunity, that **Volume** of the campaign wraps up
   with an **Annual**.


## Using the Dice {#toc-dice .breakbefore}

The dice mechanic in []{.gamename} is a **dice pool** of six-sided dice. 
When a player wants to take an uncertain action, they build a dice pool.

- One die for every point they have in the relevant Facet
- One die for every Volume if they have a relevant Skill
- Two dice if they can mark off one of their Ideals
- One die for every Power Word beyond the first
- Other dice from any other source

 Die Roll   Result
----------  ---------------------
    6       +1 Success
    5       +1 Success
    4       --
    3       --
    2       --
    1       Edge Success

Any dice that come up a 5 or a 6 are counted as Successes. 
A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).

Any dice that come up 2, 3, or 4 are ignored.

Any dice that come up 1 are counted as Edge Successes. 
When a player rolls a 1, they inform the Editor, 
who offers them a consequence. 

If the player chooses to take the Editor’s consequence, 
they count the 1 as a Success.

This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be 
narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. 
The important part is that the player is presented with a difficult choice.


## From Issues to Volumes {#toc-issues .breakbefore}

[]{.gamename} uses some terms from comic books to talk about how 
the game is played.

### Issues

Each individual game session is known as an **Issue**, and roughly
corresponds to one issue of a comic book.

The **First Issue** is the first played session of an ongoing []{.gamename} 
campaigned played by a group -- but first you should have an Issue 0.

#### Issue 0

**Issue 0** -- known as *Session 0* in other games -- is an
Issue of a []{.gamename} Series when the players don't roll dice and 
handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person
is looking forward to playing.

Issue 0 takes place before the First Issue, and should go over the 
safety tools used in the game, stress the importance of open communication, 
and set expectations on the kind of story and play.

Issue 0s are also a great time to create heroes together as a group,
rather than separately.

### Storylines

During an Issue, the Editor and the players play out the events of
a **Storyline**.

When you create a new hero, you define a specific lesson you'd like 
your hero to learn or a specific experience you'd like them to have.
For that Storyline, your character is considered the **Spotlight** hero.

Each Storyline consists of:

- the Spotlight hero
- the Opportunity
- one or more Crises connected to the Opportunity, introduced by the Editor
- the heroes' reactions to each Crisis
- the Spotlight hero's reaction the Opportunity

Many Storylines will resolve over the course of one Issue, but some
can take long and might run for 2 or 3 sessions, or longer.

Once your hero finishes your Storyline, both your hero and your 
fellow players' heroes gain an **Advancement.**

#### One-Shots

A **One-Shot** is an Issue that isn't part of a Storyline, Volume, or
Series, but stands alone. Most games played at conventions, for example,
will be One-Shots.

Sometimes a One-Shot doesn't have a Spotlight hero, meaning there's no
Opportunity either, but just a connected series of Crises. In those 
cases, all heroes receive a standard Advancements after dealing with 
the Crises.

One-Shots obviously won't have a separate Issue 0, but time should still
be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on important safety tools.

Many First Issues are One-Shots, as the players and Editor are still 
getting to know their heroes and the game. These First Issues usually
feature a few simple Crises to resolve.

### Volumes

Each Storyline is part of a **Volume**; Volumes are a grouping of
Issues -- game sessions -- and are numbered starting with 1.  

Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Storylines, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue, known as an **Annual**. 

The Annual ties together the events of the previous Storylines in the
Volume, and then that Volume concludes.

At the start of a new Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.

### Series

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a **Series,** and each 
Series is comprised of up to five Volumes. 

If your group reaches the end of Volume 5 and with to continue with
with the same heroes, you can do so: just treat later Volumes as having
a Volume number of 5, and proceed from there.

### Guest Stars and Crossovers

A **Guest Star** is a hero character from another Series -- either played
by the same group or a different one -- who plays in the Series for an
Issue or two. If the Guest Star's Volume number is higher than the group's,
temporarily lower the Guest Star to the same Volume.

A **Crossover** happens when the heroes from two or more Series work
together, usually in large, wide-ranging One-Shots. All participating 
heroes keep their normal Volume numbers without adjustment.


## Hero Origin {#toc-chargen .breakbefore}

To create your hero, you just follow these steps:

1. Pick a Class
   - Pick six Personal Power Words from your Class
   - Pick your Skills, based on your Class
   - Pick a Volume 1 ability from your Class
   - Choose 2 words as your Nova Power
2. Assign 1 point to each Facet, then distribute more 5 points as you wish
3. Pick a Fighting Style
4. Choose 5 words as Ideals
5. Describe a Storyline you'd like to play out with your hero
6. Decide your hero's Appearance and Backstory
   - Choose a Hero Name, Pronouns, and a Real Name; and decide whether the latter is a Secret Identity
   - Describe your Costume, Symbol, and General Appearance


### Hero Class

A hero's *Class* defines broad strokes of their powers, abilities,
and methods. Classes are archetypes that define how your hero fits
into a superhero world.

Each class gives the following:

- Two or more skills
- A class ability
- Two Core Power Words
- Six Personal Power words
- One class ability per Volume


### Power Words {#toc-powers .colbefore }

Your hero has a list of words called Power Words that define their
super-powers and how they use them. Power Words are used in three
different ways:

- A **Power Display**, which uses a single Power Word
- A **Power Stunt**, using two (or more) Power Words
- A **Power Combo**, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes

There are four types of Power Words:

- **Core Power Words**, unique to your class
- **Personal Power Words**, picked from your class list
- **Nova Power Words**, unique to your hero
- **Scene Power Words**, based on the situation

#### Core Power Words {#toc-power-words-core}

When you create your hero, you have two **Core Power Words** 
common to all members of your class. 
You don't have to choose them; you get them automatically.

#### Personal Power Words {#toc-power-words-personal}

In addition to Core Power Words, your hero also has 6 Personal Power Words. 
When you create your hero, choose these 6 from 
your class's list of 15 Personal Power Words. 
(If your class is Paragon, pick an extra one
from your class, and another from any class's list.)

#### Nova Power Words {#toc-power-words-nova}

Your **Nova Power Powers** can be anything; you're encouraged to use your 
Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.  

Like Ideals, you can choose any two words you like for
your hero's Nova Power Words.

Nova Power Words might look like this:

- Soaring Dragon
- Berserker Rage
- Indomitable Spirit
- Solar Flare

When you've checked off each of your hero's Ideals, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Storyline.

#### Scene Power Words {#toc-power-words-scene}

Each scene where a Crisis takes places has up to 6 Power Words
that describe the environment around your heroes. 
These are known as **Scene Power Words.**

The Editor comes up with Scene Power Words when describing a location, 
and if you think creatively, you can use them in your Power Stunts and Combos.


### Skills {#toc-skills-chargen}

Skills define what your hero does does outside of their life as
a superhero -- they could be from before gaining powers, or they
might be what they still do now.

When you create your hero, your class may give you several Skills
for free; in addition, you have at least 2 free picks.


::::::::::: soapbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Facets 

These Facets -- named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles --
were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not 
any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. 
A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, 
or as wise or charming as they like.

The other reason for these Facets is that the concept of Intelligence 
as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. 
It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, 
including racial and class injustice. 

We chose “Detective" as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve 
problems by thinking about them and gathering information, 
not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Facets {#toc-facets}

Each hero's nature is defined by their scores in 5 different facets, 
which represent their approaches to solving problems.

- **Action** - a direct, straight-forward approach
- **Adventure** - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations
- **Detective** - a logical approach, based on gathering information
- **Mystery** - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions
- **Suspense** - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment

Each of your hero's facets start with a score of 1, and you have 5 
additional points to distribute to them.

### Fighting Style {#toc-fighting-style }

Your hero specializes in one style of fighting, whether they attack 
with their fists or their powers. Those styles are:

- **Acrobat**        Reduce by 1 the cost to counter a Crisis move targeting only you.
- **Brawler**        Add 2 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal.
- **Controller**     Add 2 dice when you use a Power to advance the Outwit goal.
- **Frenzy**         Add 2 dice when you use a Power to advance the Smash Goal.
- **Interceptor**    Reduce by 1 the cost to Take the Hit for someone else.
- **Martial Artist** Add 2 dice when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Outwit goal.
- **Mediator**       Add 1 die when you advance the Allay Goal.
- **Rescuer**        Add 1 die when you advance the Rescue Goal.
- **Sharpshooter**   Add 2 dice when you use a ranged Weapon to advance the Smash goal.
- **Tactician**      Add 2 dice when you add to the Teamwork Pool.
- **Weapon Master**  Add 2 dice when you use a melee Weapon to advance the Outwit goal.

If you choose the Knight class, you get to pick an additional fighting style. 


### Ideals {#toc-ideals .colbefore}

Your hero has five Ideals that drive them to feats of 
heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen
by you when you create your hero; there's no set list.

For example, one hero could have these five Ideals:

:::::::: twocolumn :::::::
- Truth
- Justice
- Responsibility
- Restraint
- Hope
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you use all five of your hero's Ideals in a Storyline, 
your hero's Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you
unlock your Nova Power Words and can use those until the
end of current Storyline.

When a new Storyline begins, all the marked off Ideals are 
cleared and it’s time to start again.

**note: need rewrite for Facet-based**

#### Random Ideals

If you're stuck for ideas, you can roll roll two dice and 
check the following table -- or just pick up to five from 
the list that sound good.

### Your Hero's Identity {#toc-chargen-identity }

"Identity" is a general term, and you can define it however you
like for your hero. It could include their racial or cultural
identity, their sexual or gender identity, their physical appearance,
their pronouns, their disabilities (if any), their age, or
any-or-all of these.

In addition, you can decide if your hero is a normal human; a human
changed through an experiment or magic; a strange visitor from 
another world; an artificial life form; a time-traveler; or anything
else you can imagine.

*Most* heroes will go by two names -- one being their personal, 
non-superhero name and the other being their superhero code-name.

It's up to you if everyone knows your hero by both names, or if
one is a *Secret Identity* only shared with a few.

You can also decide if your hero has the same general characteristics
in all identities, or if they change from identity to the next:
are they taller or shorter in their secret ID? Do they have the same
gender in each identity?

Use your imagination, and don't be afraid to bounce ideas off your
fellow players and the Editor if you get stuck.


### Initial Storyline {#toc-storyline}

A **Storyline** is one or more connected Issues focusing on one hero,
known as the **Spotlight** hero. At a climactic part of the Storyline,
the Spotlight hero has an **Opportunity** to change -- the chance to
evaluate their assumptions and decisions, and react accordingly.

Once in each Volume, your hero gets to play through one Storyline 
where they have the Spotlight. You get to define what their *Opportunity*
will be -- it could be an important lesson they get to learn, or a
piece of information about their origin they'd never known, or an
experience you think will force them to make a difficult moral
decision.

There are five rules for creating an Opportunity:

1. **Your Hero is the _Star_** - An Opportunity can't be focused on a
   group decision or a side character's experiences, except for how
   that affects your hero.

2. **You _Want_ to Play Through It** - The Editor will plan Crises based
   on the assumption that if you ask for an Opportunity, it represents
   something you actually want to have happen to your hero in the game.
   If you *aren't* interested in it, then don't ask for it!

3. **Change is Never _Easy_** - This means that you should expect that
   any Opportunity you create represents something that your hero
   can't just easily dismiss or shrug off. If you say you want an
   Opportunity of being asked to join a villain team, then that should
   represent an actual struggle for your hero.

4. **Change is _Not_ Required** - An Opportunity is just that: the
   *chance* for a change. But it's completely valid for your hero
   to come to that Opportunity and decide they *aren't* going to 
   change.

5. **Play to Find Out** - Don't pick the outcome, just the Opportunity!
   In other words, *don't* come up with both the Opportunity *and* the 
   result of the Storyline; be open to seeing where the questions will
   take your hero and let yourself be surprised through the act of 
   playing the game.

When you create your hero, choose one Opportunity based on these five
rules; you can ask the Editor and your fellow players for advice as well.

At the end of any Storyline where your hero is *not* the Spotlight hero,
you have option of changing your Opportunity -- for exmaple, if you come
up with a better idea during another her's Spotlight.

#### Opportunity Examples

These are examples of the types of Opportunities you can create.

1. *Example* []{.lorem}
2. *Example* []{.lorem}
3. *Example* []{.lorem}
4. *Example* []{.lorem}
5. *Example* []{.lorem}


## Skills {#toc-skills .breakbefore}

Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their 
civilian life -- from their secret identity, their profession 
before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training. 

The Skills are:

::::::::::::: twocolumn ::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as

### Using Skills

When you make a roll that could be affected by one of your Skills,
you add a number of dice to the dice pool equal to the current Volume.

If you don't have a Skill, you don't add any extra dice to the pool.

## Using Powers {#toc-power-use .breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}


### Power Displays {#toc-power-displays}

When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word
and explain how you're using that power.

A Power Display doesn't cost any Might points.

Power Displays don't have a game-mechanics effect on your rolls, but you
can use them to explain how you're able to *make* those rolls. 

For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it
as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to 
the skies to throw a punch. 

If you don't have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your
Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby 
skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.

### Power Stunts {#toc-power-stunts }

A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together, and unlike
a Power Display, a Stunt will affect the result of your next roll.
In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.

When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words
and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you're
hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe
what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory
effects.

After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an
appropriate roll for your Power Stunt -- either to increase the
Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an
additional die to the dice pool for each Power Word beyond the first.

You don't have to come up with Power Stunts beforehand; instead,
you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your
creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.

For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you
could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase
"Flight Speed". Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt
means that when you make a roll -- such as rolling your Adventure
Facet to Outwit a foe -- increases the number of dice in your pool
by 1 die.


### Power Combos {#toc-power-combos }

A **Power Combo** is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work
together, with their powers combined. 

To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they'd
like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you're trying
to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are
taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.

You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long
as you can come up with an explanation of how they're helping.

The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, 
and they're called the initiating hero for that Combo.

A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt -- the player of the
initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them,
spending 1 point of Might and increasing the number of dice
of their next roll by 1 Success.

The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another
Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which adds a die to the
dice pool.

Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one 
of their Core Power Words as a *third* (or fourth) Power Word in 
the Combo.

### Using Personal Power Words {#toc-power-use-personal }

[]{.lorem}

### Using Core Power Words {#toc-power-use-core }

You can use one of your Core Power Words as a *third* Power Word 
in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, 
and adds another 1 die to the dice pool on your roll.

By spending yet 1 *more* Might point you can add your *other* 
Core Power Word as a *fourth* Power Word in a Power Stunt. 
Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 dice in the dice pool,
but also costs you 3 Might points.

For example, []{.lorem}

### Using Nova Power Words {#toc-power-use-nova }

Once you've checked all of your hero's Ideals, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Storyline.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words as the *second* Power
Word in a Stunt without spending any Might; likewise, you can add 
use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the 
Nova Power Word still increases the roll's dice pool by 1 die.

Using your *other* Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or
Power Combo requires spending 1 Might. 

For example, []{.lorem}

### Scene Power Words {#toc-power-use-scene}

Each scene has up to 6 Scene Power Words, chosen by the Editor.

You can use one Scene Power Word as a second Power Word in a 
Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, 
but they still contribute 1 die to the dice pool.

Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, 
and it likewise increases the dice pool of that Combo.

For example, []{.lorem}


## Crisis {#toc-crisis .breakbefore}

Any encounter requiring your hero's unique superheroic talents and 
powers is known as a **Crisis.**
A Crisis could be anything from a natural disaster to a runaway
train; from a group of normal criminals to one or more super-powered
villains.

There isn't a separate game system for combats and fights; those use
the same system as any other Crisis.

Each Crisis is rated in three **Goals** that describe how the heroes 
could tackle that Crisis:

- **Smash** - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Withstand** - outlast the Crisis by taking all it can throw at you


### Countdown to Crisis {#toc-crisis-countdown .colbefore}

A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem
and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a
location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need 
to present at the start of a Crisis.

The steps to take before a Crisis are:

5. Set the Scene
4. Hero Roll-Call
3. Define the Goals
2. Assemble the Teamwork Pool
1. The Crisis begins!

#### Setting the Scene {#toc-crisis-scene}

[]{.lorem}

#### Determining Who is Present {#toc-crisis-present}

[]{.lorem}

##### Innocent Bystanders {.colbefore}

Superhero fights can be dangerous for people caught in the crossfire,
and most natural or manmade disasters place people in danger.

At the beginning of the Crisis, the Editor can assign points to the
Bystander Pool. Heroes can use the Save Innocents move to reduce
the size of the Bystander Pool, while the Crisis's moves can be
used to increase it.

When the Bystander Pool is reduced to zero, there are no longer any
endangered people, although in subsequent turns, the Crisis may add
more to this pool.

This table is a rough guideline for how many people are endangered
and how large the Bystander Pool should be:

 Pool   Number             Examples
------ ------------------- --------------------------------
  1     a couple, at best  A remote highway
  2        several         A mostly empty convenience store
  3        a bunch         A bank
  4        many            A small factory
  5        very many       A supermarket
  6        a *lot*         A hospital
  7        numerous        A school
  8+       a big crowd     A crowded rock concert

When a hero reduces the size of the Bystander Pool with the Save
Innocents move, they regain a number of Might points equal to the 
number of points removed. Protecting others reinvigorates the heroes
to fight on.

If a Crisis move reduces the size of the Bystander Pool, the same 
amount is *also* subtracted from the Teamwork Pool. Being unable to
save everyone is demoralizing to all heroes.

[]{.lorem}

#### Defining the Goals {#toc-crisis-goals}

[]{.lorem}

#### Assembling the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-pool}

When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the 
initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of 
describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving
a Crisis. 

If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero
reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using
a Facet related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to
the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for
their heroes.

If your hero is *not* on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it's
being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend
from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.

Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, it’s time to start.

### Starting a Crisis {#toc-crisis-start}

Instead of having an initiative order like many games of this type, 
there are two phases that alternate back and forth: 
the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase. 

The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is 
the Hero Phase.


### Hero Phase {#toc-crisis-hero .colbefore}

The heroes can each take one move during the Hero Phase, one at a time, 
in any order they like.

While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially three
things you can choose to do: Advance a Goal, Contribute to the Teamwork Pool,
or Save Innocents.

If your hero is *not* present, you can use the Timely Arrival move.

#### Timely Arrival {#toc-crisis-timely}

When you use the Timely Arrival move, spend 5 successes from the
Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current Hero Phase. 

You can't make any other moves that turn, but you *can* describe 
your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. 
Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.

The cost of the Timely Arrival move decreases by 1 success every
Crisis Phase.

#### General Alert {#toc-crisis-alert}

If two or more heroes aren't present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at 
the scene can use their turn to sound a General Alert and call for help.
The cost of a General Alert is 1 success from the Teamwork Pool per hero called.

The heroes arrive at the start of the *next* Hero Phase, and can act
normally during that turn. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike
a Timely Arrival, they don't roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.

#### Advance a Goal {#toc-crisis-advance}

When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the 
Crisis. There are three different ways of doing this:

- **Smash** - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Allay** - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis
- **Rescue** - save people or property endangered by the Crisis

The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to 
advance it once. You don’t need to roll all these successes at once; 
you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too. 

Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, in any
combination, the Crisis ends.

#### Contribute to the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-contribute}

When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions 
that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything 
you can think of that might give your team an edge. 

You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, 
or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes. 

When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness
to the Teamwork Pool. 

[]{.lorem}

#### Save Innocents {#toc-crisis-saving}

[]{.lorem}

**replace ability to regain Might**

#### Joining a Power Combo 

**need to clarify: it doesn't cost an action, but you can use each power word only once per phase**

[]{.lorem}

### Crisis Phase {#toc-crisis-crisis .colbefore}

Once every hero has taken a move, then it’s time for the Editor
to take their turn.

Every Crisis has a set number of moves per turn. As a rule, the more 
moves a Crisis gets per turn, the more difficult it is. 
If the Crisis has the same number of moves as the hero team,
it will be very challenging.

The Editor chooses moves from the Encounter’s list of moves. Every
move has a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes 
from the Teamwork Pool, they defend against that move and nothing 
happens.

If there aren’t enough successes in the pool to defend against the
move, or if the heroes decide not to counter the move, then the 
move happens and the heroes face the consequences. 

Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting 
the heroes' ability to use a certain type of roll or move on their 
next turn, or innocents being endangered.

Once the Editor has taken enough moves, it’s time to go back to the heroes.


### Post-Crisis {#toc-crisis-post .colbefore}

[]{.lorem}


## Advancements {#toc-advancements .breakbefore}

After each Storyline concludes:

- Choose one Advancement from the following list; you can only add a Skill, Fighting Style, or Power Word once per Volume.
  - Increase your Health by 1.
  - Increase your Might by 1.
  - Add one Skill.
  - Add one Power Word from any class.
  - Add one Fighting Style.
- If you had the Spotlight, increase any one Facet by 1.
- (optional) Change one of your Ideals to any other word.
- (optional) Change your Opportunity if you haven't already taken it.

At the end of each Volume:

- Pick a new Class ability from the new Volume or a previous Volume.
- Create a new Opportunity for the new Volume.
- (optional) Change one of the following: your Personal Power Word choices, your Fighting Style choice(s), your Skill choices, or your Nova Power Words.
- (optional) Choose a new Costume, Symbol, and/or Hero Name.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats (A.L.E.R.T.)
was created by the U.S. Congress sometime after World War II and before Titan's
arrival on Earth in October of 1956 -- as they were well-equipped to handle
the Saturnian Sentinel, had it proven necessary.

A.L.E.R.T. usually works with the Cosmic Legends, although the two groups have 
clashed in the past -- most notably when A.L.E.R.T. was infiltrated by agents 
of T.R.E.L.A.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
**History:**
As a child, Sienna MacGowan heard legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann 
from her grandmother, and she claimed the Celtic gods even spoke 
to her in her dreams.

When she grew older, Sienna's dreams faded and she no longer
believed in the mythological aspects of Celtic fables. Instead,
she resolved to prove that the Tuatha Dé Danann were historical
beings as mortal as anyone else. 

Armed with an archaeology degree, Sienna was working late at a 
digsite outside the village of Skryne, when a voice called out to
her, asking why she had forgotten her dreams. The experience
repeated each night, although none save her heard the voice.

Finding no logical explanation for the phenomenon, Sienna replied
to the voice and asked who was speaking. The goddess Brigit appeared
before Sienna, told her she was the Champion of the 
Tuatha Dé Danann, and gifted her with power.

**Powers:**
When Sienna speaks the magic words, *Claidheamh Soluis*, she is
transformed into the superhumanly powerful Champion, Brigantia.
Her powers include flight, wisdom, super-speed, super-strength, 
and projection of light rays from her eyes; in times of great 
need, she can form a sword of blazing light.

**Powers:**
Jeri North's exposure to bremsstrahlung rays fundamentally changed
the nature of her body. Her skin is a rough, rocky substance with
sharp metal "hairs" scattered about, and her internal organs and skeleton
are composed of even denser materials.

This grants her a high degree of imperviousness to pain and injury,
and lets her lift in excess of 100 tons.

### Saturn {#setting-saturn}

::::::::::: place :::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Type of Location:** planet and satellites
- **Location:** 9.58 AU from Sol (average)
- **Capital:** L'Shar'Ak, Titan
- **Official Languages:** Titanese (*Ro'Tan'Kesh*)

- **Population:** unknown
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The people of Saturn's moon Titan are not native to the
Solar System; according to their oldest tales, they were
taken from their home planet by a civilization known as
the Visitors, were subjected to scientific experiments, 
and were eventually abandoned on Titan.

Titanians -- known as *Ro'Tan'Okk* in their own language --
have strong mental powers and communicate by telepathy as
often as they use *Ro'Tan'Kesh*. 

They are physically superior to humans, with most able to 
lift over 50 tons with minimal effort. Their only weakness 
is a strong reaction to being touched by salt water, which 
burns them and drains their energy.

There are four known genders among the Titanians; Earthlings
are only familiar with the *nyrr-t'vor* gender thanks to
the presence of Ty'Tonn To'Rezz on Earth. Titanian families
are comprised of 3 or more spouses and their children.

The *Ro'Tan'Okk* have no concepts of war or crime; the
closest thing to a military in Titanian society is the
*Kyl'Sh'Tal* -- the famed Sentinels of Saturn. Sentinels
are astronomers tasked with constant vigilance -- to watch
the skies for the return of the Visitors.

### Vulcanor {#setting-vulcanor}

::::::::::: place :::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Type of Location:** island chain
- **Location:** South Pacific Ocean
- **Capital:** Volcano City, Vulcanor Island
- **Official Languages:** Vulcanese, English
- **Demonym:** Vulcanor
- **Governance:** Sovereign Monarchy
- **Head of State:** Tachylus Vulcanor Rex (1918 - present)
- **Area:** approx. 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> (386 sq mi) over 14 islands
- **Population:** 100,000 (2010 estimate)
- **Time Zone:** UTC +1400
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The people of Vulcanor are an offshoot of humanity that was
experimented on by the Visitors over 3,000 years ago; their
skin was hardened to a shiny gloss and they were adapted to
live in volcanic conditions. Slaying their Visitor enslavers
and stealing a shuttle craft, they settled on an otherwise
uninhabitable remote chain of islands in the south Pacific.

That distance allowed the Vulcanors time to disassemble and
reverse-engineer many Visitor technologies, including a
compass-scrambling magnetic field that cloaked their islands
from the European colonialist powers.

With the arrival of Titan on Earth in 1956, King Tachylus 
decreed it was time to join the rest of the world and share --
in limited amounts -- their unique technologies. His son
Obsidius was sent as an emissary and later joined the
Cosmic Legends of the Universe.

Excessive heat and volcanic gasses prevent the Vulcanor 
Islands from becoming a vacation destination. While outsiders
are welcomed and treated with respect, few non-Vulcanors have 
been Volcano City.

          the Adapter’s License You apply.

       a. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
          or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
          Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    1. No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as 
       permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed 
       Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status 
       by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in 
       Section 3(A)(1)(a)(i).

       License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; 
       however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to 
       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to 
       allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

    1. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties 
       from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a

    database for Anti-Capitalist purposes only;
    
A.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in

A.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(A) if You Share all or a 
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace 
    Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other 
    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

A.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent

    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the

    may not apply to You.

    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall

    remaining terms and conditions.

A.  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply 
    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

    You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
