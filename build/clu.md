[]{.gamename} is a four-color tabletop roleplaying game where
you and your friends take the roles of super-powered heroes
who fight against injustice, right that which is wrong, and serve
all mankind.

The *[Harmony Drive](https://peachgardengames.itch.io/harmony-drive)*
system created by Cat McDonald is at the heart of []{.gamename}.

## What You Need

To play []{.gamename} you'll need:

- One player, playing as the Editor
- Two to six other players
- A copy of the game rules
- At least a half-dozen six-sided dice
- One hero sheet per player
- Pencils
- A few hours
- Your imagination!


## Ethos {#toc-ethos .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} revolves around the following three pillars:

### Self Expression

The Power Word system and Crisis system are intentionally built to 
give players freedom to engage with problems in their own style. 
[]{.gamename} lets you be yourself, and do things in your own way, 
without being left behind by your team.

### Teamwork

[]{.gamename} games is written to encourage the players to work 
together. Whether you're combining your powers to use Power Combos
or using your skills to overcome an opponent together, heroes in 
[]{.gamename} succeed or fail as a team.

### Difficult Choices

The Edge Success system is built so that you have the freedom 
to choose failure. The Crisis system is built so that you can 
choose to take big hits. Good things and bad things happen to
your hero, and both of these are in the your hands to choose. 
The Editor’s job is to give you those difficult choices.


## Overview of Play {#toc-overview .colbefore }

1. []{.gamename} is played as a series of **Storylines**, each
   taking up one or more game sessions, or **Issues**.

2. Before a new Storyline, the players decide who the **Spotlight**
   hero will be during that Storyline. 

3. The player with the Spotlight tells the Editor what **Opportunity**
   they'd like their hero to experience.

4. The Editor shapes a series of **Crises** that let the Spotlight hero
   work through that Opportunity.

5. Once each player has had the Spotlight to address their 
   hero's Opportunity, that **Volume** of the campaign wraps up
   with an **Annual**.


## Using the Dice {#toc-dice .colbefore}

The dice mechanic in []{.gamename} is a **dice pool** of six-sided dice. 
When you want your hero to take an uncertain action, you build a 
**dice pool** of six-sided dice.

:::::::::::::::::::::: dice-rolls-display :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- One die for every point you have in the relevant **Approach**:

:::::::::::::::: dice-display :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[]{.die .approach}
[]{.die .approach .dashed}
[]{.die .approach .dashed}
[]{.die .approach .dashed}
[]{.die .approach .dashed}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- One die for every Volume if you have a relevant **Skill**:

:::::::::::::::: dice-display :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[]{.die .skill .v1}
[]{.die .skill .v2 .dashed}
[]{.die .skill .v3 .dashed}
[]{.die .skill .v4 .dashed}
[]{.die .skill .v5 .dashed}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Two dice if you can mark off one of your **Ideals**:

:::::::::::::::: dice-display :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[]{.die .ideal }
[]{.die .ideal }
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- One die for every **Power Word** you're using in a **Power Display**, **Power Stunt**, or **Power Combo**:

:::::::::::::::: dice-display :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[]{.die .display .dashed}
[]{.die .stunt .dashed}
[]{.die .stunt .dashed}
[]{.die .combo .dashed}
[]{.die .combo .dashed}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- **Other** dice from any other source, such as from a Fighting Style:

:::::::::::::::: dice-display :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[]{.die .other .dashed}
[]{.die .other .dashed}
[]{.die .other .dashed}
[]{.die .other .dashed}
[]{.die .other .dashed}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Roll all of the dice and then compare the numbers:

::::::::::::: dice-display ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[]{.die .result .r6 .success}
[]{.die .result .r5 .success}
[]{.die .result .r4 }
[]{.die .result .r3 }
[]{.die .result .r2 }
[]{.die .result .r1 .edge}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Any dice that come up a **5** or a **6** are counted as **Successes.** 
A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).

Any dice that come up **2**, **3**, or **4** are ignored.

Any dice that come up **1** are counted as **Edge Successes**. 
When you roll a 1, you inform the Editor,
who offers you a **consequence**. 

If you choose to take the Editor’s consequence, you 
can count the 1 as a **Success**.

This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be 
narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. 
The important part is that you're presented with a difficult choice.


## From Issues to Volumes {#toc-issues .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} uses some terms from comic books to talk about how 
the game is played.

### Issues

Each individual game session is known as an **Issue**, and roughly
corresponds to one issue of a comic book.

The **First Issue** is the first played session of an ongoing []{.gamename} 
campaigned played by a group -- but first you should have an Issue 0.

#### Issue 0

**Issue 0** -- known as *Session 0* in other games -- is an
Issue of a []{.gamename} Series when the players don't roll dice and 
handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person
is looking forward to playing.

Issue 0 takes place before the First Issue, and should go over the 
safety tools used in the game, stress the importance of open communication, 
and set expectations on the kind of story and play.

Issue 0s are also a great time to create heroes together as a group,
rather than separately.

### Storylines

During an Issue, the Editor and the players play out the events of
a **Storyline**.

When you create a new hero, you define a specific lesson you'd like 
your hero to learn or a specific experience you'd like them to have.
For that Storyline, your character is considered the **Spotlight** hero.

Each Storyline consists of:

- the Spotlight hero
- the Opportunity
- one or more Crises connected to the Opportunity, introduced by the Editor
- the heroes' reactions to each Crisis
- the Spotlight hero's reaction the Opportunity

Many Storylines will resolve over the course of one Issue, but some
can take long and might run for 2 or 3 sessions, or longer.

Once your hero finishes your Storyline, both your hero and your 
fellow players' heroes gain an **Advancement.**

#### One-Shots

A **One-Shot** is an Issue that isn't part of a Storyline, Volume, or
Series, but stands alone. Most games played at conventions, for example,
will be One-Shots.

Sometimes a One-Shot doesn't have a Spotlight hero, meaning there's no
Opportunity either, but just a connected series of Crises. In those 
cases, all heroes receive a standard Advancements after dealing with 
the Crises.

One-Shots obviously won't have a separate Issue 0, but time should still
be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on important safety tools.

Many First Issues are One-Shots, as the players and Editor are still 
getting to know their heroes and the game. These First Issues usually
feature a few simple Crises to resolve.

### Volumes

Each Storyline is part of a **Volume**; Volumes are a grouping of
Issues -- game sessions -- and are numbered starting with 1.  

Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Storylines, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue, known as an **Annual**. 

The Annual ties together the events of the previous Storylines in the
Volume, and then that Volume concludes.

At the start of a new Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.

### Series

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a **Series,** and each 
Series is comprised of up to five Volumes. 

If your group reaches the end of Volume 5 and with to continue with
with the same heroes, you can do so: just treat later Volumes as having
a Volume number of 5, and proceed from there.

### Guest Stars and Crossovers

A **Guest Star** is a hero character from another Series -- either played
by the same group or a different one -- who plays in the Series for an
Issue or two. If the Guest Star's Volume number is higher than the group's,
temporarily lower the Guest Star to the same Volume.

A **Crossover** happens when the heroes from two or more Series work
together, usually in large, wide-ranging One-Shots. All participating 
heroes keep their normal Volume numbers without adjustment.


## Using Powers {#toc-power-use .breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}


### Power Displays {#toc-power-displays}

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-display} :::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word
and explain how you're using that power.

A Power Display doesn't cost any Might points, and has two effects:

1. You can add one die to a relevant roll
2. You can explain how your hero is able make a roll

After you use a Power Word in a Power Display, it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it
as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to 
the skies to throw a punch. 

If you don't have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your
Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby 
skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Power Stunts {#toc-power-stunts }

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-stunt} :::::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free} 
[]{.power-word .any} 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together.
In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.

When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words
and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you're
hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe
what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory
effects.

After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an
appropriate roll for your Power Stunt -- either to increase the
Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an
additional die to the dice pool for each Power Word.

You don't have to come up with your Power Stunts beforehand; instead,
you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your
creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.

After you use a Power Word in a Power Stunt, it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

:::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you
could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase
"Flight Speed". Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt
means that when you make a roll -- such as rolling your Adventure
Approach to Outwit a foe -- increases the number of dice in your pool
by 2 dice.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Power Combos {#toc-power-combos }

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-combo} :::::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free} 
[]{.power-word .any} 
[]{.plus} 
[]{.power-word .any} 
[]{.plus .dashed} 
[]{.power-word .any .dashed}
[]{.plus .dashed .dotdotdot} 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A **Power Combo** is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work
together, with their powers combined. 

To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they'd
like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you're trying
to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are
taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.

You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long
as you can come up with an explanation of how they're helping.

The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, 
and they're called the initiating hero for that Combo.

A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt -- the player of the
initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them,
spending 1 point of Might and increasing the number of dice
of their next roll by 2 Success.

The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another
Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which adds a die to the
dice pool.

Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one 
of their Core Power Words as a *third* (or fourth) Power Word in 
the Combo.

After you use a Power Word in a Power Combo -- either as the
initiating hero or as a contributing hero -- it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You can use one of your Core Power Words as a *third* Power Word 
in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, 
and adds another 1 die to the dice pool on your roll.

By spending yet 1 *more* Might point you can add your *other* 
Core Power Word as a *fourth* Power Word in a Power Stunt. 
Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 dice in the dice pool,
but also costs you 3 Might points.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Once you've checked all of your hero's Ideals, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Storyline.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words as the *second* Power
Word in a Stunt without spending any Might; likewise, you can add 
use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the 
Nova Power Word still increases the roll's dice pool by 1 die.

Using your *other* Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or
Power Combo requires spending 1 Might. 

:::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For example, []{.lorem}

Each scene has up to 6 Scene Power Words, chosen by the Editor.

You can use one Scene Power Word as a second Power Word in a 
Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, 
but they still contribute 1 die to the dice pool.

Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, 
and it likewise increases the dice pool of that Combo.

Like other Power Words, every time a Scene Power Word is used in
a Display, Stunt, or Power, it goes on Cooldown until the start
of the next Hero Phase and can't be used again until then.
