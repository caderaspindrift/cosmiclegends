::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

Martin McCord never wanted to become the world's first
One-Officer-Police-Force, but a near-fatal shootout took
that choice away from him. Seconds away from dying, his injured
brain was transplanted into the ADAM-42 android body, saving
his life and trapping him in a metal form physically superior
to, and distinctively less functional than, his original human body.

Officially, McCord is dead -- but with the right prosthetic mask,
he can pass among humans as Adam Lii, the newest recruit of the
Los Angeles Police Department.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

Titan is widely acknowledged as the first public superhero and one
of the primary leaders among the heroes.

Ty'Tonn To'Rezz's story begins on Jarnsaxa, one of the smaller, outer moons
of Saturn. There, Ty'Tonn and his spouses manned the massive telescopes and
monitoring systems created by the Sentinels of Saturn.

When the remote sensory devices detected the approach of a Visitor fleet,
Ty'Tonn was chosen to travel to *L'Shar'Ak*, capital of Titan, and present 
their findings to *Kyl'Sh'Tal* command.

According to the course computed by My'Tonn, Ty's sibling, the Visitors would
pass by just the outermost moons of Saturn and instead were on a direct path
for *W'Ty'Dah'k*, the third planet from the sun: Earth.

Fearing the harm the Visitors could do to the primitive, just-barely-nuclear
civilizations of *W'Ty'Dah'k*, Ty'Tonn urged the *Kyl'Sh'Tal* to intervene.
"Are we not the Sentinels for the entire solar system?", Ty argued; "Should we
not be concerned with the fate of all who are threatened by the Visitors?"

The *Kyl'Sh'Tal* council debated for many hours but it soon became clear that
they prioritized the survival of Titanian civilization over that of 
*W'Ty'Dah'k* -- and even considered the potentially massive loss of human
life to a net benefit to the people of Titan.

Outraged by their actions, Ty'Tonn returned to Jarnsaxa and plotted sedition
within in their spousal cluster. Ty' would head to *W'Ty'Dah'k* first, to be
followed by the rest of the cluster once contact had been established with the
Earthings.

Ty'Tonn To'Rezz arrived on Earth in October 1956 and made contact with 
the Americans' Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats
(A.L.E.R.T.). Becoming known on Earth as *Titan*, Ty'Tonn worked with
A.L.E.R.T., Marquis Malign, Vespa and Obsidius to drive back the initial
wave of Visitor landing craft and break their invasion.

Scorned by the other *Kyl'Sh'Tal* for disobedience, Ty'Tonn To'Rezz returned to 
family on Jarnsaxa, only to find that the monitoring outpost had been destroyed 
by retreating Visitor craft when the station's cloaking screens failed under 
mysterious circumstances.

Following that tragedy, Ty'Tonn relocated permanently to the planet Earth,
despite the sweltering heat, and went on to help found the Cosmic Legends of
the Universe in September 1963. For while he used the name "Tom Torres" but has
since discontinued the use of an alternate identity. Since the start of the 21
century, he has lived in Nova Scotia and has been granted honorary Canadian
citizenship.


**Powers:**

Titan is perhaps the most powerful individual on the planet.
His Titanian strength lets him lift well over 100 tons, and he is
able to project the cold frost of the Titanian sky from his
eyes as energy beams. Flight, speed, and telepathy round out his
vast array of alien powers -- which are exceptional even for a
Titanian.
