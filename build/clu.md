## Ethos {#toc-ethos .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} revolves around the following three pillars:

### Self Expression {#toc-ethos-self-expression}

The Power Word system and Crisis system are intentionally built to 
give players freedom to engage with problems in their own style. 
[]{.gamename} lets you be yourself, and do things in your own way, 
without being left behind by your team.

### Teamwork {#toc-ethos-teamwork}

[]{.gamename} is written to encourage the players to work 
together. Whether you're combining your powers to use Power Combos
or using your skills to overcome an opponent together, heroes in 
[]{.gamename} succeed or fail as a team.

### Difficult Choices {#toc-ethos-difficult-choices}

The Edge Success system is built so that you have the freedom 
to choose failure. The Crisis system is built so that you can 
choose to take big hits. Good things and bad things happen to
your hero, and both of these are in the your hands to choose. 
The Editor’s job is to give you those difficult choices.



## A Four-Color Bronze Age Superhero TTRPG {.breakbefore #toc-preface}

We describe []{.gamename} as a "four-color bronze-age superhero TRPG" --
but what do we mean by that?

Essay time!



:::::::::::::::: {.soapbox #soapbox-no-fascists } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### [No Fascists]{#soapbox-no-fascists}

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/){.external}
or something.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



### "Four-Color" {#toc-preface-four-color}

The term "four-color" refers to the printing process used
in comics that led to most heroes having bold, primary
colors for their uniforms, their bodies, their worlds.

One example is Superman's hair having *blue* overtones --
this was meant to display his hair as a lustrous black
but the capabilities time precluded that.

*Our* use of the term "four-color" doesn't refer to the 
print process for this game but instead to the general tone 
of late Silver Age and Bronze Age comics -- when primary-color 
superheroes of the '50s and '60s met the social issues of 
the '70s and '80s.



### The Ages of Comics {#toc-preface-ages}

American comics fans and scholars divide the history of 
comics into four loosely defined "ages": the Golden Age, the
Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. These are loosely
based on [Ovid's Four Ages of Mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_Man#Ovid's_Four_Ages){.external}.

[The Golden Age]{#toc-preface-ages-golden} - 1938 to 1956 

:   The Golden Age started with the introduction of Superman
    and the concept of superheroes in general.
    Many of the most well-known characters, such as Wonder Woman 
    and Captain America, were created during the Golden Age.
  
    Some comics in the Golden Age were simplistic fun, while others 
    featured dark themes, shocking gore, and vile villains.  A lot of 
    Nazis were punched in those comics, which is always a good thing.
  
    Unfortunately, racism and sexism often were major themes in Golden 
    Age comics; examples of anti-Asian hatred are all too easy to find.

[The Silver Age]{#toc-preface-ages-silver} - 1956 to circa 1970 

:   The Silver Age began when DC Comics created new versions of the Flash, 
    Green Lantern, and others, then the Justice League of America. 
    Marvel responded by creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, 
    the Avengers, the Hulk, the X-Men, and more.
  
    The Silver Age also saw the creation of the Comics Code Authority,
    a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic
    over the content of comics.
  
    Superhero comics in the Silver Age followed a long list of 
    restrictions banning everything from "horror" and "gore" 
    to "vampires" and "cannibalism". Heroes always won, villains 
    always lost, and authority figures were portrayed with respect -- 
    at least, that's what the Comics Code demanded.

[The Bronze Age]{#toc-preface-ages-bronze} - ca. 1970 to ca. 1985

:   The Bronze Age is less distinctly defined chronologically, but was 
    a time when comics went through changes: becoming more socially 
    relevant and less restrained by the CCA. More on that later.
  
[The Iron Age]{#toc-preface-ages-modern} - ca. 1985 to present

:   The current age of comics is usually dated to the end of
    DC's *Crisis on Infinite Earths* and Marvel's *Secret Wars*.

    Modern superhero comics often feature antiheroes, complex
    storylines, and mature themes. Many of the older characters
    were revamped to more contemporary versions; 
    [deconstructionism](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/deconstruction/4015-55916/){.external}
    plays a major role in the Iron Age.

    The CCA also withered away to irrelevancy as the major publishers
    increasingly often published comics without the CCA seal on the 
    cover.

### Influences

#### The Super Friends {#toc-preface-super-friends}

In case you weren't aware, this game is inspired by the 
[Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends){.external}
cartoon show that was on the air from 1973 to 1985 -- also
the years yours truly was age 5 and 16. It's fair to say
the show influenced how I view comics and superheroes
in general.

The first season has an opening monologue where the four 
heroes were "created from the cosmic legends of the universe!"

What on earth does *that* mean?  How exactly was *millionaire playboy 
Bruce Wayne* created from the __cosmic legends of the universe__?!
I've never figured that out, but it does make a great title
for our litle Bronze-Age-inspired, four-color superhero tabletop RPG.



## Safety Tools {#toc-safety .breakbefore}

Safety tools are a way for players and Editors to communicate
and check-in **before**, **during**, and **after** a game in 
order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and to provide 
the right support when needed.

The keys to safety tools are **communication and trust**. There needs 
to be open and respectful **communication** alongside a culture of 
**trust** for these to work.

Playing the []{.gamename} RPG should be enjoyable for everyone,
and to help make that happen, we recommend the following techniques.



### Before the Game {#toc-safety-before}

Before you even start playing an Issue of []{.gamename}, talk about 
what you want to see in the game -- and what you don't want to see.

If you're planning a long, open-ended Series, you may even want to 
devoted a whole session to this -- called an *Issue 0* in []{.gamename};
for shorter games you should at least touch on these topics.

#### Lines and Veils

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on content, things that the Editor or the 
players don’t want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means that the content might 
be in the game but not spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

#### Using the Comics Code {#toc-comics-code}

Don't worry, I promise the CCA isn't going to shut down your game. 

Despite how terrible the 
[Comics Code](http://cbldf.org/the-comics-code-of-1954/){.external} was 
in reality -- and it had a *stifling* effect on freedom of expression 
in comics for decades -- it *does* give an interesting snapshot of 
the types of content that might show up in a Bronze Age superhero game.

The following questions are inspired by items in the Comics Code and
are intended to start conversations -- not end them! (Remember that when
we say [heroes](#toc-glossary){.glossary} in Cosmic Legends, we're talking 
about what other games would call *player characters* -- not necessarily
about *non-player characters (NPCs) who happen to be heroic/good guys*.)

As you discuss these questions as a group, anyone should feel free to 
request a line or veil on these or any other subjects.

:::::::::::::: soapbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### [The Comics Code]{#soapbox-comics-code}

Are we saying we approve of the CCA and what it tried to do? No! 
"Self-censorship imposed to avoid government censorship" is wrong 
and we're not suggesting that the Comics Code had a beneficial effect 
on the comics of the time.

Instead, we urge you to think **not** in terms of *following the Comics Code*
but instead of *how your Series is going to deliberately break it*.
To us, that's the best way to repurpose and subvert this McCarthyistic
relic that lasted into the 21st Century at the major comics publishers.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### General Questions

::::::::::::::: cca-questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Does good always triumph over evil? Does evil sometimes
  triumph over good?

- Is profanity from NPCs acceptable? From heroes?

- Should your game avoid depictions of alcohol use, drug
  use, or drug addiction?

- Do the villains eventually get what's coming to them, or do
  some get away with their crimes?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Forces of Law and Justice

::::::::::::::: cca-questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Given the real-world history of police violence, do you want to 
  play that out in a roleplaying game?

- Do you even want to deal with the police __at all__ in your games?

- Do you want to have Storylines about corrupt judges and a justice
  system that doesn't work?

- Are glamorous, alluring, or even sympathetic villains fine, or would 
  you rather have black-and-white villainy?

- Do you want Nazis as villains in this game?

- Are the heroes criminals themselves and wanted by the authorities?
  If so, which authorities, and why?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Types of Crises

::::::::::::::: cca-questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Are you okay with Storylines about the military and war?

- Are there certain natural disasters, such as brushfires or
  earthquakes, that you're not interested in playing out?

- Would you rather not have zombies, vampires, werewolves, or other
  types of mythological monsters in your game? 

- What about more mundane creatures like spiders or snakes?

- Are there other types of Crises you don't want to deal with?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Depictions of Awfulness

::::::::::::::: cca-questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Are in-character bigotries such as ableism, racism, homophobia, 
  transphobia, or antisemitism acceptable from NPCs and villains?

- Are they acceptable from heroes?

- What about slurs spoken by NPCs, and slurs spoken by heroes?

- Do you want to restrict descriptions of violence to abstract 
  summaries instead of the gory details?

- Are there certain types of violence that you would rather
  not see in the game, such as torture, knives or guns,
  or kidnapping? Violence against children? Against animals?

- Would you be bothered by villains using mind control or other
  mental violations? Are those okay for heroes to do?

- Is it acceptable to have an NPC or hero be a rape survivor as 
  part of their backstory, or should there be no references to 
  sexual assault at all?

- Can innocent bystanders be killed during a Crisis? What about
  named NPCs the players have become attached to?

- Should the villains be able kill heroes, or should that only
  happen as part of a Storyline chosen by a player?

- Can the heroes kill? What should the *other* heroes do if a hero 
  kills a villain?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Relationships

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: cca-questions :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Does romantic attraction factor into this game at all, or is
  it something you'd rather not see? 

- Is it okay to roleplay flirting between heroes and NPCs? 
  What about between heroes?

- Should love and romance problems such as infidelity or
  divorce be avoided? Should marriage?

- Is sexual innuendo between heroes and NPCs acceptable? What
  about among the heroes themselves?

- Do you want to fade to black long before sexual content
  such as nudity or kink enters the game, or are seduction 
  scenes okay to play out up to a certain point?

- How should queer issues be handled in the game? Should the
  NPCs be inherently LGBTQIA+ friendly?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



###  During the Game {.colbefore #toc-safety-during}

When you get caught up in playing []{.gamename}, it can sometimes
be hard to gauge how everyone else is feeling. These tools can be
used while you're playing to make it easier to share.

#### Breaks

For Issues that run longer than 2 hours or Issues that have 
intense content, having a short built-in break is recommended 
to allow people to stay focused and process. Allow for 
discussion, bio breaks, or any other needs during this time.

As a general rule, the Editor should offer a break after a Crisis 
concludes. The players might not want one, in which case the
game continues.

#### Open Door

The **Open Door** is the assurance that someone can leave or take 
a break from the game for their own safety and well-being without 
being judged.  State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

#### Comic Page Change Tools {#toc-script-change}

During play, you can use **Comic Script Change Tools** to adjust 
play and content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards with the words written on them, typing the first letter of the 
move in the chat function of the video conference software or 
virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand signals. 

Before each Issue of []{.gamename}, Editors and players should
discuss how to use each of these tools.

**Retcon** can be used when something has happened in play 
that makes a participant uncomfortable.  When **Retcon** is 
used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to retcon...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a point before 
it happened, and play starts again.

**Later That Day, ...** can be used when a participant would like to 
skip past uncomfortable content or to the next part of the 
story for pacing.  When **Later** is used by tapping the card, 
typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it out loud 
("I’d like to go to later that day..."), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

**Meanwhile, ...** can be used when everyone is ready to continue play, 
often after adjusting or discussing content. When **Meanwhile** 
used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or 
stating it out loud ("Meanwhile...?"), continue with play if 
everyone agrees they're ready.

**Continued Next Page** can be used when things are too intense, 
but you still want to continue playing the scene. When **Continued**
is used by tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or 
stating it out loud ("I’d like to continue to the next page..."), 
you can take a break and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
**Continued**, you can use **Meanwhile**, **Retcon**, or **Later**.



### After the Game  {#toc-safety-after}

When you finish an Issue of []{.gamename}, it's important to look
back at the things you enjoyed the most and the things you didn't 
like as much.

#### Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over into post-game 
life. This can affect the enjoyment of the game, as well as 
out-of-game relationships between players and Editor if not 
worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game begins and ends, and being 
conscious of which feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

#### Stars and Wishes {#toc-stars-wishes}

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the session and communicate 
feedback in a positive and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed and loved 
about the game. This could include a particular moment of roleplay, 
a Crisis created by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular interactions 
between heroes, potential story moments and development, or 
anything else that could make the game even better in the future.


## Overview of Play {#toc-overview .colbefore }

1. []{.gamename} is played as a series of **Storylines**, each
   taking up one or more game sessions, or **Issues**.

2. Before a new Storyline, the players decide who the **Spotlight**
   hero will be during that Storyline. 

3. The player with the Spotlight tells the Editor what **Opportunity**
   they'd like their hero to experience.

4. The Editor shapes a series of **Crises** that let the Spotlight hero
   work through that Opportunity.

5. Once each player has had the Spotlight to address their 
   hero's Opportunity, that **Volume** of the campaign wraps up
   with an **Annual**.



## Using the Dice {#toc-dice .breakbefore}

The dice mechanic in []{.gamename} is a **dice pool** of six-sided dice. 
When a player wants to take an uncertain action, they build a dice pool.

- One die for every point they have in the relevant Facet
- One die for every Volume if they have a relevant Skill
- Two dice if they can mark off one of their Ideals
- One die for every Power Word beyond the first
- Other dice from any other source

 Die Roll   Result
----------  ---------------------
    6       +1 Success
    5       +1 Success
    4       --
    3       --
    2       --
    1       Edge Success

Any dice that come up a 5 or a 6 are counted as Successes. 
A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).

Any dice that come up 2, 3, or 4 are ignored.

Any dice that come up 1 are counted as Edge Successes. 
When a player rolls a 1, they inform the Editor, 
who offers them a consequence. 

If the player chooses to take the Editor’s consequence, 
they count the 1 as a Success.

This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be 
narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. 
The important part is that the player is presented with a difficult choice.



## [From Issues to Volumes]{#toc-issues .breakbefore}

[]{.gamename} uses some terms from comic books to talk about how 
the game is played.

### [Issues]{#toc-struct-issue}

Each individual game session is known as an **Issue**, and roughly
corresponds to one issue of a comic book. Generally, an Issue probably
takes 2 to 4 hours to play out, although your group can agree to play
a longer session or a shorter one, as time allows. Be flexible *and*
aware of others' schedules and other time constraints!

#### [Issue #0]{#toc-struct-issue-0}

::::::::::: struct ::::::::::::
<div class="issue wide zero">
  <div class="do_chargen wide"></div>
  <div class="lines_veils wide"></div>
  <div class="comics_code wide"></div>
</div>
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Issue 0** -- known as *Session 0* in other games -- is an
Issue of a []{.gamename} Series when the players don't roll dice and 
handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person
is looking forward to playing.

Issue 0 takes place before the First Issue, and should go over the 
safety tools used in the game, stress the importance of open communication, 
and set expectations on the kind of story and play.

Issue 0s are also a great time to create heroes together as a group,
rather than separately.

The **First Issue** is the first played session of an ongoing []{.gamename} 
campaigned played by a group -- but first you should have an Issue 0.

  <div class="issue"></div>
  <div class="issue"></div>
</div>
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

During an Issue, the Editor and the players play out the events of
a **Storyline**.

When you create a new hero, you define a specific lesson you'd like 
your hero to learn or a specific experience you'd like them to have.
For that Storyline, your character is considered the **Spotlight** hero.

Each Storyline consists of:

- the Spotlight hero
- the Opportunity
- one or more Crises connected to the Opportunity, introduced by the Editor
- the heroes' reactions to each Crisis
- the Spotlight hero's reaction the Opportunity

Many Storylines will resolve over the course of one Issue, but some
can take long and might run for 2 or 3 sessions, or longer.

Once your hero finishes your Storyline, both your hero and your 
fellow players' heroes gain an **Advancement.**

### [Volumes]{#toc-struct-volumes}

  <div class="storyline wide"></div>
  <div class="storyline wide"></div>
  <div class="storyline wide"></div>
  <div class="issue annual wide"></div>
</div>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Each Storyline is part of a **Volume**; Volumes are a grouping of
Issues -- game sessions -- and are numbered starting with 1.  

::::::::::::: struct :::::::::::
<div class="issue annual wide">
 <div class="recap wide"></div>
 <div class="crisis extra wide"></div>
 <div class="vignette"></div>
 <div class="vignette"></div>
 <div class="vignette"></div>
 <div class="vignette"></div>
 <div class="lettercol wide"></div>
</div>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Storylines, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue, known as an **Annual**. 

The Annual ties together the events of the previous Storylines in the
Volume, and then that Volume concludes.

At the start of a new Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.

### [Series]{#toc-struct-series}

:::::::::::::: struct :::::::::::
<div class="series wide">
  <div class="issue wide zero"></div>
  <div class="volume one extra wide"></div>
  <div class="volume two extra wide"></div>
  <div class="volume three extra wide"></div>
  <div class="volume four extra wide"></div>
  <div class="volume five extra wide"></div>
</div>
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a **Series,** and each 
Series is comprised of up to five Volumes. 

If your group reaches the end of Volume 5 and with to continue with
with the same heroes, you can do so: just treat later Volumes as having
a Volume number of 5, and proceed from there.

#### [One-Shots and Specials]{#toc-struct-one-shots}

::::::::: struct :::::::::::
<div class="issue wide">
  <div class="recap wide"></div>
  <div class="crisis wide"></div>
  <div class="crisis wide"></div>
  <div class="lettercol wide">
  </div>
</div>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A **One-Shot** is an Issue that isn't part of a Storyline, Volume, or
Series, but stands alone. Most games played at conventions, for example,
will be One-Shots.

Sometimes a One-Shot doesn't have a Spotlight hero, meaning there's no
Opportunity either, but just a connected series of Crises. In those 
cases, all heroes receive a standard Advancement after dealing with 
all the Crises.

One-Shots obviously won't have a separate Issue 0, but time should still
be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on important safety tools.

### [Guest Stars and Crossovers]{#toc-struct-crossovers}

A **Guest Star** is a hero character from another Series -- either played
by the same group or a different one -- who plays in the Series for an
Issue or two. If the Guest Star's Volume number is higher than the group's,
temporarily lower the Guest Star to the same Volume.

A **Crossover** happens when the heroes from two or more Series work
together, usually in large, wide-ranging One-Shots. All participating 
heroes keep their normal Volume numbers without adjustment.

## Hero Origin {#toc-chargen .breakbefore}

To create your hero, you just follow these steps:

:::::::::::::::: {.chargen-list } :::::::::::::::::
1. Pick a **Class**
   - Gain 2 **Core Power Words** 
   - Pick six **Personal Power Words** from your Class list
   - Choose 2 words as your **Nova Power Words**
   - Pick your **Skills**, based on your Class
   - Pick two **Volume** 1 abilities from your Class
2. Assign 1 point to each **Approach**, then distribute more 5 points as you wish
3. Pick a **Fighting Style**
4. Choose 5 words as **Ideals**
5. Describe a **Storyline** you'd like to play out with your hero
6. Choose your hero's **Name**, **Pronouns**, and **Looks**

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Hero Class

A hero's *Class* defines broad strokes of their powers, abilities,
and methods. Classes are archetypes that define how your hero fits
into a superhero world.

Each class gives the following:

- Two or more skills
- A class ability
- Two Core Power Words
- Six Personal Power words
- One class ability per Volume
- An additional class ability at Volume 1




### Skills {#toc-skills-chargen}

Skills define what your hero does does outside of their life as
a superhero -- they could be from before gaining powers, or they
might be what they still do now.

When you create your hero, your class may give you several Skills
for free; in addition, you have at least 2 free picks.



:::::::::: {.soapbox .approaches } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Approaches {#soapbox-approaches}

These Approaches -- named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles --
were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not 
any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. 
A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, 
or as wise or charming as they like.

The other reason for these Approaches is that the concept of Intelligence 
as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. 
It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, 
including racial and class injustice. 

We chose “Detective" as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve 
problems by thinking about them and gathering information, 
not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Approaches {#toc-approaches}

Each hero's nature is defined by their scores in 5 different Approaches, 
which represent their preferred methods to solve problems.

::::::::::::::: {.chargen-list } ::::::::::::::
- **Action** - a direct, straight-forward approach
- **Adventure** - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations
- **Detective** - a logical approach, based on gathering information
- **Mystery** - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions
- **Suspense** - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Each of your hero's Approaches starts with a score of 1, and you have 5 
additional points to distribute to them.


### Abilities {#toc-abilities}

**blurb about abilities** []{.lorem}

Your hero class has a number of abilities associated with it.
You automatically can use the ability common to all members
of the same hero class, called the Prime Ability.

At the start of each Volume you can pick one ability from 
that Volume's list or lower; in addition, you get an extra 
ability at the start of Volume 1.

You can take any given ability only once; either you have it
or you don't have it. There are a few abilities that are
excepts to this rule, and they specifically that you can
take them more than once.

The following diagram summarizes the abilities gained at the end of
each Volume, before the next one begins.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### [Abilities and Ability Categories]{#toc-ability-types .colbefore}

At the start of each Volume, you can choose one ability from your 
class or from the list of Generic Abilities; before Volume One, 
you can choose two abilities from either your class list or the 
list of Generic Abilities.

Each ability can be chosen only once, unless otherwise noted with
a *Repetition* statement.

You can't choose an ability if you already have that ability or a
variant of that ability. 

A *variant* is any ability that says "This is a variant of *another 
ability.*", or any ability with the same name as another ability
that you already have.

There are four categories of abilities, where each ability of that
type uses similar game rules and mechanics:

- **Arsenal Abilities** let you pick a number of single-use Core
  Power Words at the start of a Storyline;
- You can only have one *Arsenal Ability*; all Arsenal Abilities
  are considered variants of all other Arsenal Abilities;
- **Crossover Abilities** give you access to Power Words (and, usually,
  abilities) from another class;
- **Hero Cave Abilities** give you a personal headquarters where
  you can store your trophies or use your skills;
- You can only have one *Hero Cave Ability*; all Hero Cave Abilities
  are considered variants of all other Hero Cave Abilities;
- **Pet Abilities** let you have an animal companion, familiar,
  or special pet that accompanies you;
- You can only have one *Pet Ability*; all Pet Abilities are 
  considered variants of all other Pet Abilities.

For **Crossover** Abilities, the following rules apply:

- Each Crossover Ability is tied to a specific class;
- You can't already be a member of that class (including via 
  Multi-Class or Dual-Class options);
- You can't take a second Crossover Ability tied to that class.
- Some Crossover Abilities let you take abilities from that
  class instead of your own class; however, ...
- You can't take a Crossover Ability as a result of another
  Crossover Ability. For example, if you take a Crossover (Mage)
  Ability that lets you take a Mage class ability instead of one
  of your class abilities, you can't take a Mage class ability
  that's a Crossover ability itself (of another class).



::::::::::::::::::: { .classdata .breakbefore } :::::::::::
### [Generic Hero Abilities]{#toc-generic }

Each Volume, you gain a new ability from your class.
Instead of taking a Class Ability, you can choose a Generic
Hero Ability from the following lists.

#### Generic Hero Abilities

These are abilities that can be taken by any Hero of the Ability's
Volume score or higher, regardless of the Hero's class.
Each ability can be chosen only once.

##### Volume 1 Generic Hero Abilities {#list-generic-hero-abilities-v1}

At the start of Volume 1, choose two abilities from this list or from
your Class's Volume 1 Class Ability List.

::::: {.ability-list .v1 } ::::::::::

Arsenal
:   *Prerequisite: You can't have another __Arsenal__ Ability.*

    At the start of each Storyline, pick a number of Power Words
    from the Inventor or Knight Personal Power Words Lists
    equal to the Volume.

    You can use each such Power Word as a Core Power Word once
    during the current Storyline without paying any Might.
    This is an *Arsenal* Ability.

Break the Fourth Wall
:   Your hero knows they're in a comic book -- or, if you'd like, in a 
    tabletop roleplaying game based on a comic book. (Or possibly even in
    a movie or television show based on a superhero comic book.)

    When you roll to advance the Outwit goal, if you reference this
    meta-knowledge in a nonsensical way, count all 4s, 5s, or 6s as 
    successes.

Dependable Allies
:   You have a network of normal people upon whom you can rely for help. While 
    they're not quite at the level of a Knight or an Expert, they all have 
    at least one special talent that assists you in fighting crime, and are
    sworn to keep your secrets (if you have any).

    Included with this Ability is a reliable and discreet way to contact your
    allies. As a Move during the Hero Phase of a Crisis, you can spend 1 Might
    to contact one or all of your Dependable Allies.

    When you first gain this Ability, create a list of allies, with a number of
    entries on the list equal to the Volume. Add an additional ally before each
    subsequent Volume.

    Each ally is defined by three qualities: First, their name. Secondly, their
    favored Approach. And thirdly, a Skill that defines their expertise and/or
    "day job."

    For example, you could create a photojournalist named James Bartholomew and
    assign him "Action" as a favored Approach, and Journalist as his skill.

    Any ally you call in has a score of 1 for all Approaches save their favored
    Approach (which is a 4), a maximum Might score equal to the Volume, and a
    maximum Health score equal to the Volume.

    Without spending any Might to contact one or more Dependable Allies, you
    can freely propose a Vignette between your Hero and one of your Allies.

Digital Interface
:   You can connect to any computerized machine or network. When you gain 
    this Ability, you may decide if you need to touch the machine or if you
    can do it with any machine you can see. If you choose the latter, you can
    also decide whether this Ability applies to wireless or cellular networks.

    Add the word "Interface" as a Core Power Word, and the Hacker skill (if you
    don't already have it.) Whenever you make a roll for
    a Power Display, Stunt, or Combo that uses the "Interface" Power Word, add 
    the current Volume to the roll's Effectiveness. You can also do this whenever
    you make a Hacking skill roll that uses your Digital Interface.

    If you have to touch a machine to use your Digital Interface, add an 
    additional success to the roll's Effectiveness. If you are accessing wireless
    and/or cellular networks, you can make a Hacking roll at the start of each
    Hero Phase to search for public information -- without using your move for 
    that Hero Phase to make the roll.

Faithful Pet
:   *Prerequisite: You can't have another __Pet__ Ability.*
    You have a pet, that may or may not be more intelligent than other creatures
    of its type.

    This animal partner has three Core Power Words -- one chosen from the
    Totem Class's Totem Nature Power Words List, representing the animal
    form of your pet -- and two others from the Totem Class's Personal Power
    Words List. You can use each of these Core Power Words for free, once
    per Hero Phase, whenever your pet is present at a Crisis.

    Whenever you pick a new Personal Power Word, you can instead choose a
    new Core Power Word for your pet, from the Totem Class's Personal Power
    Words list.

    Your pet's Health and Might are equal to the Volume.
    Your pet's approaches are all 1, except for one Approach of your choice
    that is a 4.
    Choose one Skill possessed by your pet and a Fighting Style. You can use
    that Skill or Fighting Style whenever your pet is present at a 
    Crisis.

    During any Hero Phase, either your hero can make a move or your pet
    can make a move -- not both.

    This is a *Pet* Ability.

Hero Cave
:   []{.herocave-prereq}
    You have a hidden location that is your personal base of operations.
    Add 2 dice whenever you make a skill roll while in your Hero Cave.
    Choose two Scene Power Words from the following Hero Cave Power Words
    List:

    []{.herocave-id}

Hero Without Fear
:   You are completely fearless. If you are exposed to any fear-based 
    Crisis Moves, spend 1 Might to counter that Move for you only.
    Your lack of fear lets you take risks to save others without
    concern for your own safety: You can choose to add 2 dice when 
    you roll to advance the Rescue goal. If you do, lose 1 Health 
    or 1 Might after resolving the roll.

Local Hero
:   You and your home town are nearly synonymous. 
    You know the geography of the city like the back of your hand. 
    Add the name of your city as a single Core Power Word.
    Add 2 dice whenever you make a skill roll related to the city. 
    While you're in your home city, add 2 dice when you roll to advance 
    the Allay or Rescue goals.

    *Repetition* You can take this Ability more than once. When you do, 
    choose another city covered by this Ability.

Three-Point Landing
:   You can pull off the classic "superhero landing" with practiced ease.
    Whenever you make a roll at the end of a Crisis Countdown to 
    create the Teamwork Pool, or a roll for the 
    [Timely Arrival move](#toc-crisis-timely), any roll of 3 counts
    as a success as long as you describe a badass three-point 
    landing as part of your arrival on the scene.

Unaging
:   For whatever reason, you don't age. If you are affected by any age-themed
    Crisis Moves, you can spend 1 Might or 1 Health to counter that Move
    for yourself only.

Well-Connected
:   *Prerequisite: You can't have the __Local Hero__ Generic Ability.*
    You've regularly teamed up with a wide variety of super-heroes and are
    well known in the heroic community. As such, you can usually get in touch
    with any given hero who has specific talents that might be required for
    a Crisis.

    Whenever you roll to create the initial Teamwork Pool, add 1 additional
    success to the Pool for each Hero who is present and who isn't a regular
    teammate or partner, up to a maximum number of additional successes equaling
    the Volume.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Volume 2 Generic Hero Abilities {#list-generic-hero-abilities-v2}

At the start of Volume 2, choose an ability from this list or the Volume 1 list.

:::::::: {.ability-list .v2 } :::::::

Chameleon
:   You can change your physical features to match any person you've
    ever met, or a combination of such features. This could be a result of
    shapechanging, image induction technologies, or simply preternatural
    skill with a disguise kit.

    Add "Disguise" as a Core Power Word.

    When you use "Disguise" in a Power Display, Power Stunt, or
    Power Combo roll to advance the Outwit goal, add 2 to the 
    Effectiveness of that roll.

Cover Identity
:   You have a well-established cover identity that hides your secrets, 
    whatever those may be. Choose a name for that identity; you have 
    identification and other documentation for that identity, and you appear 
    credible in databases and online searches.

    Add "Secret" as a Core Power Word.  When you use "Secret" in a Power 
    Display, Stunt, or Combo roll to advance the Outwit goal, or when you
    make a skill roll using the Spy skill, add 2 to the Effectiveness of 
    that roll. You can only do this as long as you are in your cover identity,
    and not your true identity.

    *Repetition* You can take this Ability more than once. When you do, 
    create an additional cover identity.

    *Note* You can combine the *Chameleon* and *Cover Identity* Abilities to
    add a total of 4 successes to a roll's Effectiveness to outwit someone.

Eidetic Memory
:   You have what's sometimes called *photographic memory* -- you have perfect
    recall of anything you see, hear, read, or otherwise experience.
    Add 3 dice when you make a skill roll related to memory or knowledge.

Fighting Pose
:   You're a poser.

    You have a trademark "thing" you do during a fight -- with your
    hair, your jaw, your hands on your hips, or whatever else you
    decide makes a good aesthetics-only signature pose -- that shows 
    everyone you really mean business.

    Add the word "Signature" as a Core Power Word. When you use "Signature" as 
    a Power Word in a Power Display, Stunt, or Combo, add an additional 1 
    success to the roll's Effectiveness.

    If you're somehow disguised, using this ability breaks your disguise and 
    reveals your true identity to anyone who would be familiar with your 
    fighting style. Which could be anyone, if you're famous.

##### Volume 3 Generic Hero Abilities {#list-generic-hero-abilities-v3}

At the start of Volume 3, choose an ability from this list or any previous list.

:::::::: {.ability-list .v3 } :::::::
Ageless

:   * **Special Note:** If you are of the __Construct__, __Divine__,*
    *__Haunt__, or __Hellspawn__ classes, you can take an additional*
    *Ability of Volume 3 or lower when you select this Ability. That*
    *free ability must be one you could normally choose; i.e., from your*
    *class or a generic ability, for which you qualify.*

    You can add *Ageless* as a Personal Power Word.

    You don't age over time -- or if you do, you only do so very slowly. 
    Your natural lifespan, if you are indeed alive, is measured in 
    hundreds or thousands of years.

    Once per Crisis, you can counter any aging-associated Crisis Move 
    that affects you without spending any Might or successes from the 
    Teamwork Pool. For example, you can ignore an "old age ray" from a 
    time-themed supervillain.

    It's possible that you're hundreds or even thousands of years old.
    If you decide that you're over 100 years old, add the Historian
    skill for free.

Superhero Soundtrack

:   You have a theme song, or at least, a set of songs that inspire
    your hero to action. Pick a number of songs equal to the Volume that
    you feel fit your hero. Add an additional song at the start of each
    subsequent Volume.

    Once per Crisis you can mark off one of those songs to add 2 dice to any 
    single roll that is thematically connected with the song you're using
    or your hero's current situation.

    If your hero has the ability to generate and/or play music -- such as
    having the Performer skill or speakers in a suit of armor or vehicle -- 
    then you can choose to have that song of the soundtrack be *diegetic*,
    meaning it exists within the fiction: your hero and those around them
    are *literally* hearing that song. If you declare the song to be 
    diegetic, add 1 success to the Effectiveness of your roll.

    If you have the ability to produce the song at the gaming table, such as
    on a cell phone or laptop (or you're just a good singer), and the rest of
    your party consents, you can play (or sing) the song and add 1 success to
    the Teamwork Pool. You can combine this with declaring the song to
    be diegetic, for a total of 1 extra success added to the Effectiveness
    of the roll and 1 success added to the Teamwork Pool.

Weirdness Magnet

:   Strange things happen around you *all the time*. This means you
    are more likely to be on the scene whenever a Crisis breaks out!

    If your hero isn't present at the start of a Crisis, you can
    spend 1 Might during the *Teamwork Pool - Assemble!* phase of the
    *Countdown to Crisis* to say that you've been there the whole time --
    because you were drawn to the Crisis before other heroes were even
    aware it's a thing.

    If you use this Ability, add 3 dice when you roll to create the initial 
    Teamwork Pool.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Volume 4 Generic Hero Abilities {#list-generic-hero-abilities-v4}

At the start of Volume 4, choose an ability from this list or any previous list.

:::::::: {.ability-list .v4 } :::::::
Arch-Enemy

:   *Prerequisite: If you have the __Rogues' Gallery__ Class Ability, your 
    Arch-Enemy __cannot__ be part of it.*

    You have one particular opponent who returns time after time to bedevil you
    and the innocent people of the world. This villain could be just a dark 
    copy of yourself, with nearly identical abilities, or their own powers,
    skills, and abilities could be the complement of yours -- strong where you
    are weak, weak where you are strongest.

    At the start of a Crisis, you can choose to declare that your arch-enemy is
    the source of the Crisis. Whenever you do, the Editor describes their role 
    in that Crisis.

    Because of your familiarity in opposing each other, you add 2 to the 
    Effectiveness of any roll you make to advance one of the goals opposed by
    that member of your Rogues' Gallery. You also add 2 to the Effectiveness
    of any Skill roll that could benefit from your familiarity with these
    dastardly criminals, such as gathering clues to their current motives or 
    analyzing any equipment you've confiscated from them.
    
    In addition, increase by 1 the cost from the Teamwork Pool to avoid any 
    Crisis Move that is directed only at you -- they're *prepared* for your 
    interference, accursed do-gooder!

    Each time that you (personally) advance a goal during that Crisis, you can
    choose to mark one or two of your unmarked Ideals.

    *Repetition:* You can take this ability more than once. Each time you do,
    create a new arch-enemy. Only one arch-enemy can show up during any given
    Crisis.

Rogues' Gallery

:   *Prerequisite: If you have the __Arch Enemy__ Class Ability, your*
    *Arch-Enemy __cannot__ be part of your Rogues' Gallery.*

    You have a consistent set of foes against whom you regularly strive, and
    a kind of gruding, love-hate, quasi-professional relationship has arisen 
    between you and the members of your Rogues' Gallery.

    When you gain this Ability, create a list with a number of supervillain
    names equal the Volume, who are members of your Rogues' Gallery. You've
    clashed with them in the past, and will do so again in the future.

    Keep a copy of this list for yourself, then make an extra copy and give 
    it to the Editor. Add another name to the list before each subsequent 
    Volume, and inform your Editor so their copy of the list can be kept in
    sync with yours.

    At the start of a Crisis, you can choose to declare that a member of your 
    Rogues' Gallery is the source of the Crisis. Whenever you do, the Editor 
    selects a member from the list and describes their role in that Crisis.

    Because of your familiarity in opposing each other, you add 1 to the 
    Effectiveness of any roll you make to advance one of the goals opposed by
    that member of your Rogues' Gallery. You also add 1 to the Effectiveness
    of any Skill roll that could benefit from your familiarity with this 
    dastardly criminal, such as gathering clues to their current motives or 
    analyzing any equipment you've confiscated from them.
    
    In addition, increase by 2 the cost from the Teamwork Pool to avoid any 
    Crisis Move that is directed only at you -- they're *prepared* for your 
    interference, accursed do-gooder!

    Each time that you (personally) advance a goal during that Crisis, you can
    choose to mark one of your unmarked Ideals.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If you choose the Knight class, you get to pick an additional fighting style before Volume One.



### Ideals {#toc-ideals}

Your hero has five Ideals that drive them to feats of 
heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen
by you when you create your hero; there's no set list.

For example, one hero could have these five Ideals:

:::::::: {.chargen-list .twocolumn } ::::::::::
- **Truth**
- **Justice**
- **Responsibility**
- **Restraint**
- **Hope**
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.lorem}

When you use all five of your hero's Ideals in a Storyline, 
your hero's Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you
unlock your Nova Power Words. You can use those Nova Power Words
until the end of current Storyline.

When a new Storyline begins, all the marked off Ideals are 
cleared and it’s time to start again.

#### Random Ideals

If you're stuck for ideas, you can roll roll two dice and 
check the following table -- or just pick up to five from 
the list that sound good.

:::::: { .twocolumn .table } :::::
 Rolls  Ideal
------- ---------------
 1, 1   Honor
 1, 2   Protection

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Power Words {#toc-powers }

Your hero has a list of words called Power Words that define their
super-powers and how they use them. Power Words are used in three
different ways:

:::::::::::: {.chargen-list } :::::::::::::::::::::
- A **Power Display**, which uses a single Power Word
- A **Power Stunt**, using two (or more) Power Words
- A **Power Combo**, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are four types of Power Words:

:::::::::: {.chargen-list } :::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Core Power Words**, unique to your class
- **Personal Power Words**, picked from your class list
- **Nova Power Words**, unique to your hero
- **Scene Power Words**, based on the situation
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Core Power Words {#toc-power-words-core}

When you create your hero, you have two **Core Power Words** 
common to all members of your class. 
You don't have to choose them; you get them automatically.

#### Personal Power Words {#toc-power-words-personal}

In addition to Core Power Words, your hero also has 6 Personal Power Words. 
When you create your hero, choose these 6 from 
your class's list of 15 Personal Power Words. 
(If your class is Paragon, pick an extra one
from your class, and another from any class's list.)

#### Nova Power Words {#toc-power-words-nova}

Your **Nova Power Powers** can be anything; you're encouraged to use your 
Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.  

Like Ideals, you can choose any two words you like for
your hero's Nova Power Words.

Nova Power Words might look like this:

:::::::: {.chargen-list .twocolumn} ::::::::::::::::::::
- **Soaring Dragon**
- **Berserker Rage**
- **Indomitable Spirit**
- **Solar Flare**
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you've checked off each of your hero's Ideals, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Storyline.

#### Scene Power Words {#toc-power-words-scene}

Each scene where a Crisis takes places has up to 6 Power Words
that describe the environment around your heroes. 
These are known as **Scene Power Words.**

The Editor comes up with Scene Power Words when describing a location, 
and if you think creatively, you can use them in your Power Stunts and Combos.



### Your Hero's Identity {#toc-chargen-identity }

"Identity" is a general term, and you can define it however you
like for your hero. It could include their racial or cultural
identity, their sexual or gender identity, their physical appearance,
their pronouns, their disabilities (if any), their age, or
any-or-all of these.

In addition, you can decide if your hero is a normal human; a human
changed through an experiment or magic; a strange visitor from 
another world; an artificial life form; a time-traveler; or anything
else you can imagine.

*Most* heroes will go by two names -- one being their personal, 
non-superhero name and the other being their superhero code-name.

It's up to you if everyone knows your hero by both names, or if
one is a *Secret Identity* only shared with a few.

You can also decide if your hero has the same general characteristics
in all identities, or if they change from identity to the next:
are they taller or shorter in their secret ID? Do they have the same
gender in each identity?

Use your imagination, and don't be afraid to bounce ideas off your
fellow players and the Editor if you get stuck.



### Initial Storyline {#toc-storyline}

A **Storyline** is one or more connected Issues focusing on one hero,
known as the **Spotlight** hero. At a climactic part of the Storyline,
the Spotlight hero has an **Opportunity** to change -- the chance to
evaluate their assumptions and decisions, and react accordingly.

Once in each Volume, your hero gets to play through one Storyline 
where they have the Spotlight. You get to define what their *Opportunity*
will be -- it could be an important lesson they get to learn, or a
piece of information about their origin they'd never known, or an
experience you think will force them to make a difficult moral
decision.

There are five rules for creating an Opportunity:

1. **Your Hero is the _Star_** - An Opportunity can't be focused on a
   group decision or a side character's experiences, except for how
   that affects your hero.

2. **You _Want_ to Play Through It** - The Editor will plan Crises based
   on the assumption that if you ask for an Opportunity, it represents
   something you actually want to have happen to your hero in the game.
   If you *aren't* interested in it, then don't ask for it!

3. **Change is Never _Easy_** - This means that you should expect that
   any Opportunity you create represents something that your hero
   can't just easily dismiss or shrug off. If you say you want an
   Opportunity of being asked to join a villain team, then that should
   represent an actual struggle for your hero.

4. **Change is _Not_ Required** - An Opportunity is just that: the
   *chance* for a change. But it's completely valid for your hero
   to come to that Opportunity and decide they *aren't* going to 
   change.

5. **Play to Find Out** - Don't pick the outcome, just the Opportunity!
   In other words, *don't* come up with both the Opportunity *and* the 
   result of the Storyline; be open to seeing where the questions will
   take your hero and let yourself be surprised through the act of 
   playing the game.

When you create your hero, choose one Opportunity based on these five
rules; you can ask the Editor and your fellow players for advice as well.

At the end of any Storyline where your hero is *not* the Spotlight hero,
you have option of changing your Opportunity -- for exmaple, if you come
up with a better idea during another her's Spotlight.

#### Opportunity Examples

These are examples of the types of Opportunities you can create.

1. Brigantia needs to learn that not everything can be solved by punching something.
2. I want Percival to cross swords with another Arthurian knight.
3. Kelly wants to confront poachers who harm sea animals.
4. I want Jack to get asked out by some villain dude.
5. The Sentinel of Saturn needs to let humans make their own mistakes.
6. I want Rockstar to be invited to join a new band.
7. Lin wants to fight one of their mother's supervillains.


## Skills {#toc-skills .breakbefore}

Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their 
civilian life -- from their secret identity, their profession 
before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training. 

::::::::::::: {.twocolumn .skill-column-list} ::::::::::::::::::
The Skills are:

- Academic
- Artist
- Bureaucrat
- Criminal

- Investigator
- Journalist

- Mystic
- Performer
- Physician
- Pilot

- Spy
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as
determined by your class, which may also give additional skills.

### Using Skills

When you make a roll that could be affected by one of your Skills,
you add a number of dice to the dice pool equal to the current Volume.

If you don't have a Skill, you don't add any extra dice to the pool.

### Skill Descriptions

The skills in []{.gamename} are listed below, along with 3 to 5 
suggestions how you could use the skill with your hero's Approaches,
and consequences the Editor can propose on an Edge Success.

#### Losing Health or Might

If you lose Health, you can describe how you injured yourself while
using your skill. Losing Might generally means becoming tired, possibly
from stress or overwork.

You can only choose a consequence for an Edge Success that injures
another hero with the permission of that hero's player.

:::::::::::::::: {.soapbox .small } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
## [Skills and Realism]{#soapbox-skills-and-realism}

Keep in mind that []{.gamename} is *a four-color game,* not a simulation
of reality -- so Skills follow "comic book logic" rather than working
as they really *should* in real life.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Deputy
:   You are -- or were -- a police officer of some kind. If you 
    like, you can be currently deputized by a local, federal, or

:   You can build high-tech devices. This is the four-color version
    of "Engineering", not real-world __engineering__.
    You can choose one or more optional specialties, representing
    what kinds of engineering you're best at; if you do, add 1 die to any
    roll related to those specialties.

    With enough time and a laboratory or workshop, you can create
    a gadget that gives the user up to three Power Words from
    the Inventor Personal Power Words list as Core Power Words.
    The maximum number of words you can place in such a gadget
    equals the Effectiveness of your Engineer roll.
    This gadget can be used only once, and doesn't require
    Might to activate either or both Core Power Words.
    The gadget will only function up to the start of the next
    Crisis Countdown.

    Characters with an *Arsenal* ability can't use such gadgets,
    unless their ability comes from a non-scientific source.
    You can also reset anyone's *Arsenal* ability, if it's already
    been used and comes from a scientific source.

        the current Crisis and the start of the next Crisis Countdown.
      - You use up the last of your supplies on this device.
      - The device is so complex that only __you__ can make it work in the field.
      - It takes much more time than you thought it would.
      - Lose 1 Health or 1 Might.
      - Anyone in your laboratory loses 1 Health.
  
Explorer
:   You're at home in the wilds, and have a great sense of direction. Optionally,
    you can choose one or more types of terrain as specialties; if you do, add 1 die

## Using Powers {#toc-power-use .breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}



### Power Displays {#toc-power-displays}

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-display} :::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word
and explain how you're using that power.

A Power Display doesn't cost any Might points, and has two effects:

1. You can add one die to a relevant roll
2. You can explain how your hero is able make a roll

After you use a Power Word in a Power Display, it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it
as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to 
the skies to throw a punch. 

If you don't have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your
Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby 
skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



### Power Stunts {#toc-power-stunts }

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-stunt} :::::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free} 
[]{.power-word .any} 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together.
In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.

When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words
and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you're
hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe
what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory
effects.

After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an
appropriate roll for your Power Stunt -- either to increase the
Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an
additional die to the dice pool for each Power Word.

You don't have to come up with your Power Stunts beforehand; instead,
you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your
creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.

After you use a Power Word in a Power Stunt, it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

:::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you
could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase
"Flight Speed". Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt
means that when you make a roll -- such as rolling your Adventure
Approach to Outwit a foe -- increases the number of dice in your pool
by 2 dice.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Power Combos {#toc-power-combos }

:::::::::::::: {.power-chart .power-combo} :::::::::::::::::
[]{.power-word .first .any .free} 
[]{.power-word .any} 
[]{.plus} 
[]{.power-word .any} 
[]{.plus .dashed} 
[]{.power-word .any .dashed}
[]{.plus .dashed .dotdotdot} 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A **Power Combo** is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work
together, with their powers combined. 

To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they'd
like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you're trying
to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are
taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.

You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long
as you can come up with an explanation of how they're helping.

The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, 
and they're called the initiating hero for that Combo.

A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt -- the player of the
initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them,
spending 1 point of Might and increasing the number of dice
of their next roll by 2 Success.

The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another
Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which adds a die to the
dice pool.

Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one 
of their Core Power Words as a *third* (or fourth) Power Word in 
the Combo.

After you use a Power Word in a Power Combo -- either as the
initiating hero or as a contributing hero -- it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

## Crisis {#toc-crisis .breakbefore}

Any encounter requiring your hero's unique superheroic talents and 
powers is known as a **Crisis.**
A Crisis could be anything from a natural disaster to a runaway
train; from a group of normal criminals to one or more super-powered
villains.

There isn't a separate game system for combats and fights; those use
the same system as any other Crisis.

Each Crisis is rated in four **Goals** that describe how the heroes 
could tackle that Crisis:

- **Smash**  - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Allay**  - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis
- **Rescue** - save people or property endangered by the Crisis


### Countdown to Crisis {#toc-crisis-countdown }

A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem
and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a
location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need 
to present at the start of a Crisis.

The steps to take before a Crisis are:

5. Set the Scene
4. Hero Roll-Call
3. Define the Goals
2. Assemble the Teamwork Pool
1. The Crisis begins!

#### Setting the Scene {#toc-crisis-scene}

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}

##### Scene Power Words

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}

#### Hero Roll-Call {#toc-crisis-present}

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}

#### Defining the Goals {#toc-crisis-goals}

[]{.lorem}

- **Smash**  - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Allay**  - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis
- **Rescue** - save people or property endangered by the Crisis

For example, []{.lorem}

#### Teamwork Pool -- Assemble! {#toc-crisis-pool}

When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the 
initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of 
describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving
a Crisis. 

If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero
reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using
an Approach related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to
the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for
their heroes.

If your hero is *not* on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it's
being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend
from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.

For example, []{.lorem}

### Starting a Crisis {#toc-crisis-start}

Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, it’s time to start dealing with the Crisis.

Instead of having an initiative order like many tabletop roleplaying games,
there are two phases during a Crisis that alternate back and forth: 
the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase. 

The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is 
the Hero Phase.




### Hero Phase {#toc-crisis-hero }

The heroes can each take one move during the Hero Phase, one at a time, 
in any order they like.

While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially two
types of move you can make: Advance a Goal or Contribute to the Teamwork Pool.

If your hero is *not* present, you can use the Timely Arrival move.

#### Advance a Goal {#toc-crisis-advance}

When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the 
Crisis. There are four different ways of doing this:

- **Smash**  - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Allay**  - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis
- **Rescue** - save people or property endangered by the Crisis

The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to 
advance it once. You don’t need to roll all these successes at once; 
you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too. 

Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, in any
combination, the Crisis ends.

For example, []{.lorem}

#### Contribute to the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-contribute}

When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions 
that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything 
you can think of that might give your team an edge. 

You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, 
or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes. 

When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness
to the Teamwork Pool. 

For example, []{.lorem}

#### Hero Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves}

[]{.lorem}

##### Power Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-power}

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}

##### Joining a Power Combo  {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-join}

**need to clarify: it doesn't cost an action, but you can use each power word only once per phase**

For example, []{.lorem}

##### Fighting Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-fighting}

[]{.lorem}

##### Skill Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-skill}

[]{.lorem}

##### Other Moves {#toc-crisis-hero-moves-other}

[]{.lorem}

##### Timely Arrival {#toc-crisis-timely}

When you use the Timely Arrival move, spend 5 successes from the
Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current 
Hero Phase. 

You can't make any other moves that turn, but you *can* describe 
your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. 
Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.

The cost of the Timely Arrival move decreases by 1 success after 
every Crisis Phase.

##### General Alert {#toc-crisis-alert}

If two or more heroes aren't present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at 
the scene can use their move to sound a General Alert and call for help.
The cost of a General Alert is 1 success from the Teamwork Pool per hero 
called.

The heroes arrive at the start of the *next* Hero Phase, and can act
normally during that Phase. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike
a Timely Arrival, they don't roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.



### Crisis Phase {#toc-crisis-crisis }

Once every hero has made a move, then it’s time for the Editor
to make moves for the Crisis.

Every Crisis has a set number of moves per Crisis Phase. 
As a rule, the more moves a Crisis gets per Phase, the more 
difficult it is. 
If the Crisis has the same number of moves as the hero team,
it will be very challenging.

The Editor chooses moves from the Crisis’s list of moves. Every
move has a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes 
from the Teamwork Pool, they defend against that move and nothing 
happens.

If there aren’t enough successes in the pool to defend against the
move, or if the heroes decide not to counter the move, then the 
move happens and the heroes face the consequences. 

Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting 
the heroes' ability to use a certain type of roll or move on their 
next turn, or innocents being endangered.

Once the Editor has taken enough Crisis moves, it’s time to go back 
to the heroes.



### Post-Crisis {#toc-crisis-post }

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}



## Advancements {#toc-advancements .breakbefore}

Advancements are how you reflect your hero's growth over the
course of a Volume and Series.

After each Storyline concludes, choose one Advancement from the following list:

- Increase your Health by 1.
- Increase your Might by 1.
- Add one Power Word from your hero Class.
- Add one Skill; you can only choose this Advancement once per Volume.
- Add one Power Word from any hero Class's Power Words list; you can only choose this Advancement once per Volume.
- Add one Fighting Style; you can only choose this Advancement once per Volume.

### Spotlight Hero

If you had the Spotlight for that Storyline, increase any one Approach 
by 1. This is in addition to the normal Advancement for the end of a
Storyline.

### Changes

Optionally, you could can make any or all of these changes to your hero:

- Change one of your Ideals to any other word.
- Change your Opportunity if you haven't already completed your Storyline.

### Volume Advancements

At the end of each Volume:

- Pick a new Class ability from the new Volume or a previous Volume.
- Create a new Opportunity for the new Volume.

#### Changes

In additional, you can choose one or more of the following changes to your hero:

- Switch one of your Personal Power Words for another from your class.
- Switch your Fighting Style to any other Fighting Style.
- Switch one of your Skill choices for another Skill.
- Change your Nova Words to any other two words.
- Choose a new Costume, Symbol, or Hero Name.

### Experienced Heroes

If you're creating a new hero for an ongoing Series, you don't
start at Volume One -- instead, your hero starts at the same Volume as
everyone else. See [the next section](#toc-experience-heroes) for 
complete details.

#### Class Abilities

You start with the Class Ability from your class, and one Class
Ability per Volume, of that Volume or lower.

#### Advancements

You get a number of Advancements equal to the number of other Heroes
for each previous Volume. You can't add more Skills, Personal Power
Words, or Fighting Styles than the number of completed Volumes.



### [Creating Experienced Heroes]{#toc-experienced-heroes}

In general, heroes in []{.gamename} are created at Volume 1. But
sometimes you might need to create a more advanced hero. Why?

- You're replacing a retired (or dead) hero and the Series is
  Volume 2 or higher.
- You're joining an ongoing Series of Volume 2 or higher.
- You're playing in a [Special Issue or One-Shot](#toc-struct-one-shots) 
  of Volume 2 or higher.
- You're playing as a [Guest Star](#toc-struct-crossover) in an
  ongoing Series of Volume 2 or higher.
- Your group decided to start the Series at Volume 2 or higher.

As described in the section on [Advancements](#toc-advancements), 
you get to choose one Advancement at the conclusion of each
Storyline. However, each hero in a series gets one 
[Storyline](#toc-issues) where they're the Spotlight Hero, every
Volume.

So the number of Advancements earned by a hero depends on how many
heroes are in the Series! This is demonstrated in the following table.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: table-wide ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Table: Number of Storylines, by Volume Number

| Number of Heroes | Volume 1 | Volume 2 | Volume 3 | Volume 4 | Volume 5 | Volume 6 | ...  |
| :--------------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :--: |
|       2          |    2     |     4    |    6     |    8     |    10    |    12    |  +2  |
|       3          |    3     |     6    |    9     |   12     |    15    |    18    |  +3  |
|       4          |    4     |     8    |   12     |   16     |    20    |    24    |  +4  |
|       5          |    5     |    10    |   15     |   20     |    25    |    30    |  +5  |
|       6          |    6     |    12    |   18     |   24     |    30    |    36    |  +6  |
|       7          |    7     |    14    |   21     |   28     |    35    |    42    |  +7  |
|       8          |    8     |    16    |   24     |   32     |    40    |    48    |  +8  |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

An average number of heroes is four (4); if you're making an experienced 
hero and you don't know how many heroes are in the Series, you can use 4 
as your baseline.

There are two types of Advancements: those you can choose as many times as you
like, and those you can choose only once per Volume. In the following rules,
it's assumed that your hero chooses each of the once-per-Volume abilities in every
Volume.

**History:**

"As a child, Sienna MacGowan heard legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann 
from her grandmother, and she claimed the Celtic gods even spoke 
to her in her dreams.

When she grew older, Sienna's dreams faded and she no longer
believed in the mythological aspects of Celtic fables. Instead,
she resolved to prove that the Tuatha Dé Danann were historical
beings as mortal as anyone else. 

Armed with an archaeology degree, Sienna was working late at a 
digsite outside the village of Skryne, when a voice called out to
her, asking why she had forgotten her dreams. The experience
repeated each night, although none save her heard the voice.

Finding no logical explanation for the phenomenon, Sienna replied
to the voice and asked who was speaking. The goddess Brigit appeared
before Sienna, told her she was the Champion of the 
Tuatha Dé Danann, and gifted her with power."


**Powers:**

"When Sienna speaks the magic words, *Claidheamh Soluis*, she is
transformed into the superhumanly powerful Champion, Brigantia.
Her powers include flight, wisdom, super-speed, super-strength, 
and projection of light rays from her eyes; in times of great

- **Gender:** male (he/him)
- **Identity:** secret
- **Place of Birth:** Chicago, Illinois
- **Marital Status:** single
- **Base of Operations:** 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

Del Thompson grew up in the shadow of brilliance -- his mother and namesake,
Delphine Thompson, was one of the most gifted physicists of her generation.

Unfortunately, her genius led her to take dangerous risks, including going
online with an experimental cold fusion reactor before all the appropriate
safeties were online. "You only need those when things go wrong," Delphine
explained to her son, then ten years old. "And I never get things wrong."

As fate would have it ... that was the time that Thompson's hubris was proven
a false vanity. The reactor raged out of control as dangerous energies washed
over her laboratory and the rest of Technopolis.

With Delphine unconscious and dying from radiation poisoning, only quick 
thinking by Del managed to halt the out-of-control reaction -- at the cost
of his life. The young boy was completely disintegrated.

Or so everyone believed. Over the next few weeks, Del reformed his body
from pure nuclear energy. He regained consciousness to find his
mother had survived -- but had likewise been changed by the overloaded
reactor. Calling herself Neutrino, she fled police custody and soon joined
the newly-forming Villains, Inc.

Del was taken in by his mother's former lab partner, Hazel Montgomery,
the original Vespa. Together with Montgomery's child Lin -- the sidekick
hero Bug -- Del became one of the first two students at Technopolis Academy 
and a founding member of the Junior Legends of America.


**Powers:**

Del's natural state of being is a humanoid form composed of supercharged plasma.
He can use this energy as destructive blasts, as an energy-backed "nuke punch!", 
and as a force bubble to absorb energy.

With concentration -- and as a result of years of practice -- he can dampen
his nuclear energies and assume a human shape, becoming the young man he would
have been had his mother's pride not cost them both dearly.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

Percival Pellinore, the Grailknight, is *the* Percival of myth -- member
of Arthur's Round Table, son of Pellinore, questing knight of the Holy Grail.

Although Percival is reluctant to speak of his past, he has told a few that
he swore an oath to find and recover the Chalice of the Last Supper, and
that he would never rest until he had fulfilled said oath.

Either his unflagging devotion to his vow or the divine nature of his mission
have kept him alive, and no older than middle aged, for centuries. Percival's
legend weaves in and out of history -- surfacing in one war only to disappear
for a century after it and reappearing around the world.

In 1963, over 50 years since his last appearance, Percival joined with other
heroes of the time to repell Xana Mega's Fomorian invasion. Percival's offhand
mention of the Table Round led to the formation of these heroes as a team,
the Cosmic Legends of the Universe.

With a tendency to vanish for weeks or years at a time, Percival is at best
a part-time member of the Cosmic Legends, although whenever evil is ascendent, 
he is an implaccable foe and resourceful ally.


**Powers:**

Sir Percival has only one confirmed power:
immortality. Due to his vows, he's unable to die until he
completes his quest and finds the Grail.

- **Legal Status:** unknown
- **Gender:** male (he/him)
- **Identity:** unknown
- **Place of Birth:** unknown
- **Marital Status:** unknown

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

The Head Librarian has no idea who he is or where he
is from. He awoke in a field outside of Peshawar, Pakistan,
as an adult with no memory of his prior life -- but the 
ability to understand and speak every language he 
encountered. No database on Earth -- digital or analog --
contains any record of the man.

He was instrumental in helping the Cosmic Legends defeat
Glytch's attempts to digitize Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 
accepted an invitation to join the team.


**Powers:**

All information is an open book to the Head Librarian, whether
in printed form, digital, or mental. He can instantly read any
book by touching it, and his psychic powers let him browse
through the thoughts and memories of others as easily as looking
up a definition in a dictionary.

Although he can absorb information at tremendous speeds, his
memory retention is not superhuman. The Librarian can hold only
a few books in memory at once before the information starts to
fade. For this reason, he brings reference materials with him
in the field -- "If I don't know the answer, I can look it up!"
is his motto.

In addition to his purely mental powers, the Head Librarian's
rudimentally telekinetic powers let him lift books off the
ground and move them about.

# Jack Dee, Master Magister {#setting-jackdee}

- **Real Name:** John Arthur Dee VIII
- **Occupation:** Lawyer, mage
- **Legal Status:** Citizen of the United States

- **Place of Birth:** Sacramento, California

- **Base of Operations:** 
- **Group Affiliation:** State Bar of California, Cosmic Legends of the Universe (*reserve member*)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**


Jack Dee would really rather be doing anything else right now, instead of
saving the world from the latest mystical threat.
  
The scion of a long line of magical champions, Jack planned to be a lawyer --
not a superhero. Corporate law is just so much more lucrative than 
wizardly troubleshooting.

Even as his mother Maddie founded the Cosmic Legends of the Universe as Miss Magister,
Jack pursued other interests -- even serving as the Cosmic Legends' attorney
at times. 

When Maddie retired from the Cosmic Legends, her brother Johnny Dee -- Jack's uncle -- 
assumed her position as the Master Magister. Johnny's tenure as Master Magister was
cut short by the duplicity of Sequana, who stole his power before taking his life.

Maddie and Jack worked together to avenge Johnny, but the strain was too much for
the elder Dee; with her dying breath, she bequeathed her power and position to
Jack, naming him as the new Master Magister. He currently serves as a reserve member
of the Cosmic Legends, joining as a specialist on missions involving the occult and
supernatural.


**Powers:**


As the Master Magister, Jack Dee's magical powers are limited only by his 
imagination and his force of will. He can conjure shields, travel in astral 
form, cloud the senses of the weak-willed, and call upon the strength of his 
ancestral line to banish evil.

He's also a fairly decent attorney.

# Obsidius Rex {#setting-obsidius-rex}

![Obsidius Rex](art/jeshields/obsidius_rex.png){#art-obsidius-rex}
::::::::::::::: {.bio} 
:::::::::::::::

- **Real Name:** Obsidius Vulcanor Rex
- **Occupation:** Prince, adventurer
- **Legal Status:** Citizen of Vulcanor
- **Gender:** male (he/him)
- **Identity:** public
- **Place of Birth:** Volcano City, Vulcanor Island
- **Marital Status:** single
- **Known Relatives:** Limuo Pele Vulcanor[]{.icon-female} (mother), Tachylus Vulcanor Rex[]{.icon-male} (father), Igneia Vulcanor[]{.icon-female} (sister)
- **Base of Operations:** 
- **Group Affiliation:** Vulcanor Royal Family, Cosmic Legends of the Universe (*founding member*, *reserve member*), N.O.V.A. Labs (*founding member*)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

For most Earthlings, Obsidius was the first Vulcanor they'd ever
heard of; the inhabitants of the Volcano Isles kept themselves 
isolated for centuries from the primative outside world.

The oldest child of King Tachylus and Queen Limuo, Obsidius was raised
to be the heir to the advanced Vulcanor civilization. From an early
age, he trained with weapons and studied statecraft and the sciences.

While just a young man, Tachylus sent Obsidius as an emissary, first
to meet Titan and then to the outside world in general. Shortly after
the Cosmic Legends were created, he joined as their first non-founding
member.

Obsidius's recklessness as a young man led to several diplomatic
incidents with the outside world, including a tense but brief cold
war with New Zealand.

The ensuing decades have mellowed the crown prince's temper, and he's
regarded as an elder statesman in the superhero community -- to his
amusement, as 75 years of age is still considered young by Vulcanor
standards.

King Tachylus, on the other hand, is no longer a young monarch and is
showing his age. Obsidius's mother, Limuo, has renounced her title
and separated from Tachylus, while their younger child, Igneia, was
exiled for attempting to murder the rest of the Royal Family.

These have put additional stresses on Obsidius to find a spouse and
produce a future successor, if just to prevent Vulcanor from 
descending into a civil war between his many squabbling cousins were
something to happen to the king and prince.


**Powers:**

Like all Vulcanors, Obsidius is superhumanly strong, able to lift 
several tons and resist small-arms fire with his stony skin. He's 
also completely impervious to heat of any kind.

Obsidius's rank as the Crown Prince gives him limited control over 
rock and earth, although he has done little to actively develop 
those abilities.

- **Real Name:** Kelly Liang
- **Occupation:** lifeguard, marine biologist

- **Identity:** (mostly) secret
- **Place of Birth:** Honolulu, Hawai'i
- **Marital Status:** single
- **Known Relatives:** none
- **Base of Operations:** 
- **Group Affiliation:** Cosmic Legends of the Universe, University of Hawai'i faculty

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

"Kelly Liang always loved the sea; while a high school
student in Hawai'i she took a job as a lifeguard, even
though her family was wealthy enough that she didn't
*need* to work.

While working that very job, Kelly was stung by a mutated
jellyfish in the process of saving a drowning woman. 
She managed to make it safely back to shore before from 
the strange toxins in her blood.

Kelly lay in a coma for three weeks, while her parents
saw that she received the best care that money could buy --
including an experimental treatment that brought her
back to consciousness.

Although she was awake, the experience had left her weakened
and barely able to move. Giving up her beloved surfing
hobby, Kelly threw herself into the study of biochemistry
and marine biology, eventually becoming a professor.

Years after her life-changing accident, Kelly managed to
a synthesize a cure for the poisons that ravaged her body --
and also found a strange side effect had given her control
over water!

Dubbing herself Riptide, Liang became a superhero and eventually
was invited to join the Cosmic Legends. She still teaches 
marine biology at the university; Kelly's identity as Riptide is 
an open secret among most Hawai'ians.

But as Riptide is the most prominent and popular superhero 
of Hawai'i, the people of the islands are happy to maintain 
the polite fiction that there's no connection between Professor
Liang and the Hero of Hilo."


**Powers:**

"Riptide has complete telekinetic control over liquid water, 
with limited control over ice and water vapor. She can condense
atmospheric water to liquid form, and can instantly melt or
evaporate solid ice.

She can propel herself at speeds up to 100 m.p.h. underwater
or on the surface of a body of water, and 50 m.p.h. over land."

- **Real Name:** Ty'Tonn To'Rezz

- **Base of Operations:** 
- **Group Affiliation:** Cosmic Legends of the Universe (*founding member*, *reserve member*), N.O.V.A. Labs (*founding member*, co-founder), Sentinels of Saturn (*resigned*)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

Titan is widely acknowledged as the first public superhero and one
of the primary leaders among the heroes.

Ty'Tonn To'Rezz's story begins on Jarnsaxa, one of the smaller, outer moons
of Saturn. There, Ty'Tonn and his spouses manned the massive telescopes and
monitoring systems created by the Sentinels of Saturn.

When the remote sensory devices detected the approach of a Visitor fleet,
Ty'Tonn was chosen to travel to *L'Shar'Ak*, capital of Titan, and present 
their findings to *Kyl'Sh'Tal* command.

According to the course computed by My'Tonn, Ty's sibling, the Visitors would
pass by just the outermost moons of Saturn and instead were on a direct path
for *W'Ty'Dah'k*, the third planet from the sun: Earth.

Fearing the harm the Visitors could do to the primitive, just-barely-nuclear
civilizations of *W'Ty'Dah'k*, Ty'Tonn urged the *Kyl'Sh'Tal* to intervene.
\"Are we not the Sentinels for the entire solar system?\", Ty argued; \"Should we
not be concerned with the fate of all who are threatened by the Visitors?\"

The *Kyl'Sh'Tal* council debated for many hours but it soon became clear that
they prioritized the survival of Titanian civilization over that of 
*W'Ty'Dah'k* -- and even considered the potentially massive loss of human
life to a net benefit to the people of Titan.

Outraged by their actions, Ty'Tonn returned to Jarnsaxa and plotted sedition
within in their spousal cluster. Ty' would head to *W'Ty'Dah'k* first, to be
followed by the rest of the cluster once contact had been established with the
Earthings.

Ty'Tonn To'Rezz arrived on Earth in October 1956 and made contact with 
the Americans' Agency for the Licensing of Extra-Human Resources and Threats
(A.L.E.R.T.). Becoming known on Earth as *Titan*, Ty'Tonn worked with
A.L.E.R.T., Marquis Malign, Vespa and Obsidius to drive back the initial
wave of Visitor landing craft and break their invasion.

Scorned by the other *Kyl'Sh'Tal* for disobedience, Ty'Tonn To'Rezz returned to 
their family on Jarnsaxa, only to find that the monitoring outpost had been 
destroyed by retreating Visitor craft when the station's cloaking screens 
failed under mysterious circumstances.

Following that tragedy, Ty'Tonn relocated permanently to the planet Earth,
despite the sweltering heat, and went on to help found the Cosmic Legends of
the Universe in September 1963. For while he used the name "Tom Torres" but has
since discontinued the use of an alternate identity. Since the start of the 21
century, he has lived in Nova Scotia and has been granted honorary Canadian
citizenship.


**Powers:**

Titan is perhaps the most powerful individual on the planet.
His Titanian strength lets him lift well over 100 tons, and he is
able to project the cold frost of the Titanian sky from his
eyes as energy beams. Flight, speed, and telepathy round out his
vast array of alien powers -- which are exceptional even for a
Titanian.

- **Base of Operations:** 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

"As a young girl, Hazel Montgomery showed a talent for technology
that eventually brought her to the attention of A.L.E.R.T. who tasked
her with analyzing and reverse-engineering Titanian science once
Titan revealed himself to the world.
  
Eventually she became a field operative for A.L.E.R.T., using a suit 
of armor of her own creation. As Vespa, she was a founding member of
the Cosmic Legends of the Universe; as Hazel Montgomery, she was a
founding director of N.O.V.A. Labs.

Although gifted with science, Montgomery had worse luck when it came
to interpersonal relationships. 

Phineas Pann, her mentor, was revealed as the criminal mastermind 
behind T.R.E.L.A. Her \"storybook romance\" with Magnus, Marquis
of Vadyvokia, fell apart shortly after the birth of their child Lin.
Delphine Thompson, Hazel's former partner at N.O.V.A., turned to a 
life of villainy as Neutrino. Lin seemingly took a criminal turn
as the Hornette, although this was later revealed to be a ruse.

Montgomery had retired from active duty with the Cosmic Legends
when she sacrificed her life to repel the Visitors' Third Visitation.
Her child Lin adopted the name Vespa 2.0 as an homage to the beloved
heroine and mother."

- **Group Affiliation:** Technopolis Academy ((graduated)), Cosmic Legends of the Universe, Villains, Inc. ((as Hornette; expelled)), Junior Legends of America (*reserve member*)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

As the child of Hazel Montgomery, charter member of the
Cosmic Legends of the Universe, and Marquis Malign, regarded by
many as the greatest supervillain of history, Lin Montgomery
carries the weight of a very heavy pedigree in the superhero 
world.

Conceived shortly after their parents wed in secret and before 
Malign's coup propelled him to the throne of Vadyvokia, Lin
grew up surrounded by the Cosmic Legends. To many, they were
the archetypal \"kid sidekick\" as Bug the Binary Bantling.

Although their first suit of armor was wholly lacking in 
offensive systems, Lin made certain ... *alterations* to the
Bug armor, giving it capabilities beyond merely defensive uses.

Along with their foster brother Del Thompson, Lin formed the
Junior Legends of America; the pair were also the first 
students at the newly chartered Technopolis Academy, and Lin
its first graduate.

Once they had graduated, Lin was contacted by Magnus Malign, who
seemingly convinced them to adopt a villainous persona as
the Hornette and join Villains, Inc. Eventually this cooperation 
was revealed as a ruse that helped bring down VI, 
but it also led to Marquis Malign disowning them and swearing
eternal enmity.

Lin was still operating as the Hornette and serving in the Cosmic
Legends in their mother's stead when the Third Vistation
arrived on Earth and began to process the population of the planet
for abduction to a distant star. 

Only the alliance of the Cosmic Legends, the Junior Legends, 
and Marquis Malign's forces was able repel the Visitors -- and
at the cost of Hazel Montgomery's life.

Shaken by this loss, Lin changed their name to Vespa 2.0 and
rededicated themself to fighting for justice.


**Powers:**

Lin Montgomery has no powers; all of their
abilities come from their armored suit. As the crown marquex
of Vadyvokia, Lin may possess some sorcerous potential, but has
never trained those.

##### Alien Patrol Saucers
##### 3 Actions

- **Smash:  3** destroy the alien ships
- **Outwit: 5** trick the aliens into leaving Earth
- **Allay:  3** understand the aliens' goals
- **Rescue: 3** save potential abductees

A small cluster of alien space-saucers is attacking the local shopping
mall, trying to abduct innocent bystanders.

::::::::::::::::::: rules ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Scene Power Words
:   announcement, crowds, display, escalator, food-court, indoor,
    mallrats, merchandise, panic, parking, sale, security

Language Barrier
:   You can't advance the Allay goal unless you are able to
    communicate with the aliens.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: moves ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Crowds in Danger (2)
:   The aliens fire blasts at the roof of the mall, causing
    debris to fall below. All goals except Rescue increase by
    2 until you advance the Rescue goal.

Impenetrable Force Field (4)
:   A nearly invisible bubble of solid force surrounds the
    aliens' saucers; the heroes can't advance the Smash goal
    next Hero Phase.

Maser Cannons (2)
:   An alien gunner fires their ship's cannons at the heroes.
    One hero takes 3 damage.

Sonic Probe Waves (2)
:   Choosing one of the heroes, the aliens fire sonic waves
    to measure their powers and abilities. That hero can't
    use the Suspense approach for the rest of the Crisis,
    and takes 1 extra damage if shot with the masers for each
    time they've been probed.

Tractor Beam (3)
:   One of the heroes is caught in the aliens' tractor beam
    and is unable to move. Advance the Smash or Outwit goal
    to free the hero.

Tranq Gas (4)
:   Fearing attacks from the heroes, the aliens release a
    foul-smelling tranquilizer gas. All heroes lose 2
    Might as the gas saps their strength.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: resolve ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Smash
:   With their saucer fleet in disarray, the aliens are
    easily disarmed and taken into custody.

Outwit
:   Having determined that they won't be able to find
    what they are looking for on Earth, the aliens abandon
    any captured bystanders and make haste for the edge of
    the atmosphere.

Allay
:   As the heroes speak with the aliens, the invaders 
    stand down, explaining the reason for their
    journey to the planet Earth.

Rescue
:   With the mall completely evacuated, the aliens' kidnapping
    mission has failed, and they beat a hasty retreat.

Defeat
:   If the heroes can't stop the aliens, they will kidnap
    12 innocent bystanders, minus 2 for every time the
    heroes advanced a goal. As a followup, the heroes can
    track the aliens to their mothership.

#### Rival Heroes {#toc-sample-rivals}

Rival Hero crises introduce other superheroes who work alongside the 
primary heroes of the game, presumably working toward the same goals.
They might not get along with each other even though they're on the same
team; an explicit campaign of one-upsmanship may ensue, competing for glory
as they advance the Smash, Outwit, Allay, and Rescue goals. 

Vignettes between heroes from rival groups can be useful for contrasting the
unte'
primary heroes with their rivals in terms of approach, ideals, and powers --
unlike other non-hero characters, rival heroes can still use actions and make action rolls to advance goals, often to embarass or deligitimize the more
established team of heroes in the game.

Rival Heroes Teams are usually built like Supervillain TEams or Alt-Universe Teams -- with defined classes, Approaches, Power Words, Ideals, and Abilities like those possessed by the primary heroes.
Their Teamwork pool is tracked separately from the heroes', and can only be added to, or used on behalf of, the team affiliated with that that teamwork pool. Heroes or villains from separate teams can't join in combos initiated by individuals from those other hero or villain teams.

##### Building Other Teams 

Crises that center on other teams of super-powered individuals, such as
Rival Heroes Team Crises, or Super-Villain Team Crises, or Alternate-Universe Crises, need to have those teams built.

Each crisis-team can take a number of actions in a round equal to their numbers of members. Create each member as you would a hero character -- choose a class for that hero character and distribute 5 points to their approaches as heroes distribute 5 to their own, all of which start at 1.

A crisis-team has a separate teamwork-pool that can be added to, and used onbehalf of, members of that crisis-team. If fighting a villain crisis-team, the heroes can't spend the villains' teamwork-pool to avoid those villains' attacks.

Pick skills, abilities, and approaches that make sense for those crisis-team
members. If one is meant to be the opposite number to a secretivive hero who doesn't trust their own members, consider giving that crisis-team opposite a high score in the Detective approach.

While it can be tempting to make rivals, supervillains, and alt-universe variants that are identical to the series' primary heroes with color-swapped costumes and evil facial hair ... it's also one of the least interesting things you do when you create a crisis-team group. Mixing up their classes. abilities, approaches, ideals, and power-words requires more work, but lets you avoid palatte-swapped retreads of familiar heroes.

::::::::::::::::::: rules ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Scene Power Words
:   list, of, twelve, possible, power, words

Special Rules
:   One or more additional rules that describe how the primary heroes deal with members of the crisis-team. These rules setup the barriers between how the two teams can relate to each other -- for example, if they can work together or directly attack each other. As a general rule, it requires as many successes to counter another team's moves as the amount of Might spent by that team to produce the move's effects. For example, if it costs the heroes 3 Might to pull off a combo that could knock out their rivals, the rival crisis-team could counter that effect by spending 3 Successes from their own teamwork-pool. They can use their own moves to add to their teamwork-pools, or force the heroes to spend from their own to teamwork-pool to counter their moves' effects. Abilities that can advance, reduce, add to, teamwork-pools can be used on any crisis-team's teamwork-pools; whenever a crisis-team succcessfully advances a Goal, the members of that team earn the Might refresh from advancing the Goal, not all characters who are members of involved crisis-teams when a Goal advances.
::::::::::::: moves ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
When you write up a crisis-team, list all of that team members' class moves and abilities
using the standard method for writing up a crisis. You'll need to track Might and Health separately for each member of each crisis-team, so you may want to give them complete character sheets that have boxes for tracking Might and Health.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::::: resolve :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
If the crisis-team are opposed to the primary heroes, give them moves and resolutions that let them roll-back or hinter Goal advancements -- villains or rivals may have moves that kill bystanders instead of Resuing them, or increasing the number of bystandards that need need to be rescued. They could even roll-back Goal advancements by the heroes if they've proven particularly effective at smashing down down crises or allaying the causes of those criseses. "Too Many Chefs" is a classic move for a rival crisis-team that reduces the main hero team's abilities to Outwit a crisis. Subtract 1 effectiveness from the next Outwit roll by the heroes after the crisis-team spends at least 1 Might on the Too Many Chefs move, representing the uncoordinated attempts at "help" from untrained teammates trying to work together.
Too Many Chefs (1 per each crisis-team member)
Subtract 1 from the effectiveness of the next heroes' outwit move for each crisis-team member who spends at least 1 Might on the *Too Many Chefs* move.
You're Not Helping (1 per each crisis-team member)
Reduce the hero-team's teamwork-pool by a number of successes limited by the size of the crisis-team; each success removed from the crisis-team's teamwork-pool removes one success from the hero-team's teamwork-pool.

#### Alternate Universes {#toc-sample-alternate-universes}

Alt Universe crises take familiar characters and twist them into unregognizable personalities andmotivations. In this way they're quite similar to a supervillain team or a rival superhero team -- described later in the Crises section.

In some situations, the main heroes end up in an alternate universe, and the inhabitants of that universe are people they already know from their original universe -- and their primary goal may be to return home even if they don't set everything "right" in the alt-universe.

Related vignettes include heroes who find alternate versions of people they care about, and how they choose to relate to those variants. Some alt-universes are parallel timelines, and heroes may end up waxing nostalgic about what could have been, and debating whether they feel responsible for these worlds
that are very similar to "home".

Because of these similarities in personalities ad histories, the heroes may be at a distinct advantage over any variants they encounter. If a variant is an alternate-timeline version of one of their loved ones, they could know more about that variant than the alt-universe natives know of the heroes' lives in their own universe. 

"Aha, so you became a Knight when your parents were murderered by a random street criminal, while I became a Knight when my children were murdered by a random street criminal." "As our own Titan is vulnerable to saline water, I hypothesize that yours might have a similar weaknesss, being a Sentinel from an analogue of our Saturn."

**Powers:**
Hyperion is perhaps the most powerful individual on the planet, 
rivalled only by Titan.
His Titanian strength lets him lift well over 100 tons, and he is
able to project the cold frost of the Titanian sky from his
eyes as energy beams. Flight, speed, and telepathy round out his
vast array of alien powers -- which are exceptional even for a
Titanian.

You can use one of your Core Power Words as a *third* Power Word 
in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, 
and adds another 1 die to the dice pool on your roll.

By spending yet 1 *more* Might point you can add your *other* 
Core Power Word as a *fourth* Power Word in a Power Stunt. 
Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 dice in the dice pool,
but also costs you 3 Might points.

use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the 
Nova Power Word still increases the roll's dice pool by 1 die.

Using your *other* Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or
Power Combo requires spending 1 Might.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Each scene has up to 6 Scene Power Words, chosen by the Editor.

You can use one Scene Power Word as a second Power Word in a 
Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, 
but they still contribute 1 die to the dice pool.

Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, 
and it likewise increases the dice pool of that Combo.

Like other Power Words, every time a Scene Power Word is used in
a Display, Stunt, or Power, it goes on Cooldown until the start
of the next Hero Phase and can't be used again until then.

acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such 
rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the 
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

### Section 1 – Definitions.

### Section 2 – Scope.

A.  License grant.

    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby 
       grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, 
       irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to 
       produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for Anti-Capitalist purposes 
       only.
       
    1. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions 
       and Limitations apply to Your use, this License does not apply, and You do not 
       need to comply with its terms and conditions.
       
    1. Term. The term of this License is specified in Section 6(A).

    1. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor 
       authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether 
       now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary 
       to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or 
       authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to 
       exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to 
       circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this License, 
       simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(A)(4) never produces 
       Adapted Material.
       
    1. Downstream recipients.

       a. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the 
          Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise 
          the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this License.

       a. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient 
          of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor 
          to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of 
          the Adapter’s License You apply.

       a. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
          or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
          Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    1. No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as 
       permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed 
       Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status 
       by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in 
       Section 3(A)(1)(a)(i).
       
A.  Other rights.

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this 
       License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; 
       however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to 
       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to 
       allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
       
    1. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License.

    1. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties 
       from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a 
       collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory 
       licensing scheme. 


### Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following 
conditions.

A.  Attribution.

    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

       a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed 
          Material:

          i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any 
             others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by 
             the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

          i. a copyright notice;

          i. a notice that refers to this License;

          i. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

          i. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably 
             practicable;

       a. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication 
          of any previous modifications; and

       a. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this License, and 
          include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this License.

    1. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(A)(1) in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed 
       Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by 
       providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required 
       information.

    1. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information 
       required by Section 3(A)(1)(a) to the extent reasonably practicable.

A.  Cooperative

    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(A), if You Share Adapted Material 
    You produce, the following conditions also apply.

    1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be an Anti-Capitalist license and 
       conform to the specifications in Section 1(J) to the extent reasonably 
       practicable.

    1. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's 
       License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to 
Your use of the Licensed Material:

A.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(A)(1) grants You the right to extract, 
    reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the 
    database for Anti-Capitalist purposes only;
    
A.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in 
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is 
    Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(B); and
    
A.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(A) if You Share all or a 
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace 
    Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other 
    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

A.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent 
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and 
    makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed 
    Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without 
    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the 
    presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where 
    disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer 
    may not apply to You.

A.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on 
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

A.  This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights 
    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

A.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
    6(A), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured 
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    1. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(B) does not affect any right the 
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed 
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed 
    Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.

A.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

A.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or 
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

A.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed 
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
    conditions of this License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be 
    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
    Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this 
    License.

A.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed 
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall 
    be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the 
    remaining terms and conditions.

A.  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply 
    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

A.  Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation 
    upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or 
    You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

## CODE OF THE COMICS MAGAZINE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC.

### Adopted October 26, 1954

#### PREAMBLE

The comic-book medium, having come of age on the American cultural scene, 
must measure up to its responsibilities.

Constantly improving techniques and higher standards go hand in hand with 
these responsibilities.

To make a positive contribution to contemporary life, the industry must seek 
new areas for developing sound, wholesome entertainment. The people 
responsible for writing, drawing, printing, publishing, and selling comic 
books have done a commendable job in the past, and have been striving toward 
this goal.

Their record of progress and continuing improvement compares favorably with 
other media in the communications industry. An outstanding example is the 
development of comic books as a unique and effective tool for instruction and 
education. Comic books have also made their contribution in the field of 
letters and criticism of contemporary life.

In keeping with the American tradition, the members of this industry will and 
must continue to work together in the future.

In the same tradition, members of the industry must see to it that gains made 
in this medium are not lost and that violations of standards of good taste, 
which might tend toward corruption of the comic book as an instructive and 
wholesome form of entertainment, will be eliminated.

Therefore, the Comics Magazine Association of America, Inc. has adopted this 
code, and placed strong powers of enforcement in the hands of an independent 
code authority.

Further, members of the association have endorsed the purpose and spirit of 
this code as a vital instrument to the growth of the industry.

To this end, they have pledged themselves to conscientiously adhere to its 
principles and to abide by all decisions based on the code made by the 
administrator.

They are confident that this positive and forthright statement will provide an 
effective bulwark for the protection and enhancement of the American reading 
public, and that it will become a landmark in the history of self-regulation 
for the entire communications industry.
