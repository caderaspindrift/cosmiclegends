## From Issues to Volumes {#toc-issues .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} uses some terms from comic books to talk about how 
the game is played.

### Issues

Each individual game session is known as an **Issue**, and roughly
corresponds to one issue of a comic book.

The **First Issue** is the first played session of an ongoing []{.gamename} 
campaigned played by a group -- but first you should have an Issue 0.

#### Issue 0

**Issue 0** -- known as *Session 0* in other games -- is an
Issue of a []{.gamename} Series when the players don't roll dice and 
handle Crises, but instead discuss what kind of game each person
is looking forward to playing.

Issue 0 takes place before the First Issue, and should go over the 
safety tools used in the game, stress the importance of open communication, 
and set expectations on the kind of story and play.

Issue 0s are also a great time to create heroes together as a group,
rather than separately.

### Storylines

During an Issue, the Editor and the players play out the events of
a **Storyline**.

When you create a new hero, you define a specific lesson you'd like 
your hero to learn or a specific experience you'd like them to have.
For that Storyline, your character is considered the **Spotlight** hero.

Each Storyline consists of:

- the Spotlight hero
- the Opportunity
- one or more Crises connected to the Opportunity, introduced by the Editor
- the heroes' reactions to each Crisis
- the Spotlight hero's reaction the Opportunity

Many Storylines will resolve over the course of one Issue, but some
can take long and might run for 2 or 3 sessions, or longer.

Once your hero finishes your Storyline, both your hero and your 
fellow players' heroes gain an **Advancement.**

#### One-Shots

A **One-Shot** is an Issue that isn't part of a Storyline, Volume, or
Series, but stands alone. Most games played at conventions, for example,
will be One-Shots.

Sometimes a One-Shot doesn't have a Spotlight hero, meaning there's no
Opportunity either, but just a connected series of Crises. In those 
cases, all heroes receive a standard Advancements after dealing with 
the Crises.

One-Shots obviously won't have a separate Issue 0, but time should still
be set aside at the start of the Issue to touch on important safety tools.

Many First Issues are One-Shots, as the players and Editor are still 
getting to know their heroes and the game. These First Issues usually
feature a few simple Crises to resolve.

### Volumes

Each Storyline is part of a **Volume**; Volumes are a grouping of
Issues -- game sessions -- and are numbered starting with 1.  

Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Storylines, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue, known as an **Annual**. 

The Annual ties together the events of the previous Storylines in the
Volume, and then that Volume concludes.

At the start of a new Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.

### Series

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a **Series,** and each 
Series is comprised of up to five Volumes. 

If your group reaches the end of Volume 5 and with to continue with
with the same heroes, you can do so: just treat later Volumes as having
a Volume number of 5, and proceed from there.

### Guest Stars and Crossovers

A **Guest Star** is a hero character from another Series -- either played
by the same group or a different one -- who plays in the Series for an
Issue or two. If the Guest Star's Volume number is higher than the group's,
temporarily lower the Guest Star to the same Volume.

A **Crossover** happens when the heroes from two or more Series work
together, usually in large, wide-ranging One-Shots. All participating 
heroes keep their normal Volume numbers without adjustment.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Abilities

**blurb about abilities** []{.lorem}

Your hero class has a number of abilities associated with it.
You automatically can use the ability common to all members
of the same hero class, called the Prime Ability.

At the start of each Volume you can pick one ability from 
that Volume's list or lower; in addition, you get an extra 
ability at the start of Volume 1.

You can take any given ability only once; either you have it
or you don't have it. There are a few abilities that are
excepts to this rule, and they specifically that you can
take them more than once.

The following diagram summarizes the abilities gained at
each Volume.
