# Cosmic Legends of the Universe

> In the great Hall of Heroes are assembled the world's greatest
> superheroes: the Cosmic Legends of the Universe!

[]{.gamename} is a four-color tabletop roleplaying game where
you and your friends take the roles of super-powered heroes
who fight against injustice, right that which is wrong, and serve
all mankind.

<div class="harmony-drive-logo">
  <a href="https://peachgardengames.itch.io/harmony-drive">
    <img src="art/DrivenByHarmonyLogo.png" alt="Driven By Harmony" />
  </a>
</div>

The *[Harmony Drive](https://peachgardengames.itch.io/harmony-drive)*
system created by Cat McDonald is at the heart of []{.gamename}.

## Ethos {#toc-ethos}

[]{.gamename} revolves around the following three pillars:

### Self Expression

The Power Word system and Crisis system are intentionally built to 
give players freedom to engage with problems in their own style. 
[]{.gamename} lets you be yourself, and do things in your own way, 
without being left behind by your team.

### Teamwork

[]{.gamename} games is written to encourage the players to work 
together. Whether you're combining your powers to use Power Combos
or using your skills to overcome an opponent together, heroes in 
[]{.gamename} succeed or fail as a team.

### Difficult Choices

The Edge Success system is built so that you have the freedom 
to choose failure. The Crisis system is built so that you can 
choose to take big hits. Good things and bad things happen to
your hero, and both of these are in the your hands to choose. 
The Editor’s job is to give you those difficult choices.

## Influences

[]{.lorem}

## What You Need

To play []{.gamename} you'll need:

- One player, playing as the Editor
- Two to six other players
- A copy of these game rules
- At least a half-dozen six-sided dice
- One hero sheet per player
- Pencils
- A few hours
- Your imagination!

## No Fascists

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) or something.

## Safety Tools {#safety .breakbefore}

Playing the []{.gamename} RPG should be enjoyable for everyone.

To ensure that everyone has an enjoyable experience, we recommend techniques
from the *TTRPG Safety Toolkit* that we've included below. 
You should not play []{.gamename} without using at least
one such tool in your game.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: tstoolkit ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### What are safety tools?

Sometimes games have content or situations
where a player or Editor may feel stressed out,
unsafe, or otherwise not having fun. Safety tools
are a way for players and Editors to communicate
and check-in before, during, and after a game in
order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and
to provide the right support when needed.

Communication, trust, and care
The key to safety tools is communication and
trust. There needs to be open and respectful
communication alongside a culture of trust for
these to work.

As an Editor, player, or organizer, you can create
this culture by making it clear that the care and
well-being of everyone at the table comes before
the game or story. This can be done by actively
listening to everyone, offering accomodations and
safety tools, implementing actions when asked
while not prying (nobody owes you their trauma
as explanation), and actively checking in before,
during, and after a game.

#### Before the Game Begins

[]{.lorem}

##### Session 0

Session 0s are a great way to begin
communication, set expectations on the kind of
story and play, and introduce and discuss what
safety tools will be used at the table.

##### Lines and Veils

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries
on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on
content, things that the Editor or the players don’t
want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are
soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means
that the content might be in the game but not
spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the
game.

##### Script Change Rating

**Script Change** ratings are used to set tone and
boundaries for your game. Using film ratings (or
your own), you can outline what audience you’re
playing for (e.g. PG-13 vs R). 

The **rating** also
addresses what content players do want to see
as well as what they don’t want to see. Make sure
to balance and respect everyone’s do and don’t
wants. 

**Ratings** and do-and-don’t-want content can
be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

#### During the Game

[]{.lorem}

##### X, N, and O Cards

**X**, **N**, and **O cards** are check-in tools. They can be
used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in
the chat function of the video conference software
or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand
signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone
that they are available and how to use them.

The **X card** can be used at any point if a
participant is uncomfortable with the content
happening in-game. When the **X card** is used by
tapping the card or typing an **“X”** in the chat, the
group can change, rewind, or skip the content.

The **N card** can be used at any point if a participant
feels like they are headed towards an X. When the
**N card** is used by tapping the card or typing an
**“N”** in the chat, the group can change the content
or have the scene “fade to black.”

The **O card** can be used at any point if a
participant wants to continue with the content.
When the **O card** is used by tapping the card
or typing an **“O”** in the chat, the group is ok to
continue with the content. They can also regularly
be prompted by a **“O?”** asked out loud or in the
chat to check-in if everyone is still ok.

#### Script Change

The **Script Change RPG Toolbox** is a collection
of tools that can be used to adjust play and
content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the
video conference software or virtual tabletop you
are using, or using hand signals. Before the game
begins, remind your players that they are available
and how to use them.

[Rewind]{.icon .rewind} can be used when something
has happened in play that makes a participant
uncomfortable. When [Rewind]{.icon .rewind} is used by
tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to rewind...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a
point before it happened, and play starts again.

[Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} can be used when a
participant would like to skip past uncomfortable
content or to the next part of the story for pacing.
When [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to fast forward...”), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

[Pause]{.icon .pause} can be used when things are too
intense, but you still want to continue playing the
scene. When [Pause]{.icon .pause} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to pause...”), you can take a break
and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
[Pause]{.icon .pause}, you can [Resume]{.icon .resume}, 
[Rewind]{.icon .rewind}, [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff}.

[Resume]{.icon .resume} can be used when everyone is ready
to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing
content. When [Resume]{.icon .resume} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“Let’s resume...”), continue with play.

##### Open Door

The **Open Door** is the assurance that someone
can leave or take a break from the game for their
own safety and well-being without being judged.
State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

##### Breaks

For games longer than 2 hours or games that have
intense content, having a short built-in break is
recommended to allow people to stay focused and
process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any
other needs during this time.

#### After the Game

[]{.lorem}

##### Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over
into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment
of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships
between players and Editor if not worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game
begins and ends, and being conscious of which
feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

##### Stars and Wishes

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the
session and communicate feedback in a positive
and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed
and loved about the game. This could include a
particular moment of roleplay, a Crisis created
by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular
interactions between heroes, potential story
moments and development, or anything else that
could make the game even better in the future.

##### Highlight Reel and Wrap Session

Similar to **stars and wishes**, Script Change
has **Highlight Reel** and **Wrap Session**. 

The **Highlight Reel** is used to reflect on the session
and highlight moments participants enjoyed. At
the end of the game, go around and get everyone
to state highlight of the game for them. This
could include a particular moment of roleplay,
Crisi created by the Editor, or anything else
that stuck out as something awesome during the
game. 

The **Wrap Session** is an opportunity for the
group to reflect on the session and discuss what
could be improved going forward. At the end of the
game, go around and open up discussion about
the game. This could include content participants
didn’t feel comfortable calling pause or rewind at
the time, or talking about emotional impacts and bleed.

There should be no social pressure to disclose
the details or trauma to justify why someone felt
uncomfortable or unsafe during the game, as long
as the discussion moves towards how to address
the issues going forward.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Rolling Dice {#toc-dice .breakbefore}

The dice mechanic in []{.gamename} is a pool of six-sided dice. 
When players want to take an uncertain action, they build a dice pool.

- One die for every point they have in the relevant Facet
- One die for every Volume if they have a relevant Skill
- Two dice if they can mark off a relevant part of their Motivation

Any dice that come up a 5 or a 6 are counted as Successes. 
A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).

Any dice that come up 2, 3, or 4 are ignored.

Any dice that come up 1 are counted as Edge Successes. 
When a player rolls a 1, they inform the Editor, 
who offers them a consequence. 

If the player chooses to take the Editor’s consequence, 
they count the 1 as a Success.

This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be 
narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. 
The important part is that the player is presented with a difficult choice.

[]{.lorem}


## Issues, Story Arcs, Series, and Volumes {#toc-issues .breakbefore}

An adventure in []{.gamename} is known as a Story. A Story
consists of one or more Crises introduced by the Editor, and
the heroes' reactions to those challenges.

Each individual game session is known as an Issue. 
Most Stories will resolve over one Issue, but some can take longer.

When you create a new hero, you define a Story Arc that describes 
a specific lesson you'd like them to learn or a specific experience 
you'd like them to have.  Once your hero finishes your Story Arc, 
both your hero and your fellow players' heroes gain an Advancement.

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a Series, 
and each Series is comprised of up to five Volumes, beginning
with Volume 1.

Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Story Arcs, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue that ties together 
the previous Story Arcs, and that Volume ends.

At the end of a Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.


## Hero Creation {#toc-chargen .breakbefore}

To create your hero, follow these steps:

- Pick a Class
  - Pick six Personal Power Words from your Class
  - Pick your Skills, based on your Class
  - Pick a Volume 1 ability from your Class
  - Choose 2 words as your Nova Power
- Assign 1 point to each Facet, then distribute more 5 points as you wish
- Choose 5 words as Motivations
- Pick a Fighting Style
- Create a Story Arc you'd like to play out with your hero
- Choose a Hero Name, Pronouns, and a Real Name, and decide whether the latter is a Secret Identity
- Describe your Costume, Symbol, and General Appearance


### Facets {#toc-facets}

Each hero's nature is defined by their scores in 5 different facets, 
which represent their approaches to solving problems.

- **Action** - a direct, straight-forward approach
- **Adventure** - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations
- **Detective** - a logical approach, based on gathering information
- **Mystery** - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions
- **Suspense** - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment

Each of your hero's facets start with a score of 1, and you have 5 
additional points to distribute to them.

::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Designer's Note: Facets 

These Facets -- named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles --
were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not 
any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. 
A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, 
or as wise or charming as they like.

The other reason for these Facets is that the concept of Intelligence 
as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. 
It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, 
including racial and class injustice. 

We chose “Detective" as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve 
problems by thinking about them and gathering information, 
not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Motivations {#toc-motivation .colbefore}

Your hero has five Motivations that drive them to feats of 
heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen
by you when you create your hero; there's no set list.

For example, one hero could have these five Motivations:

- Truth
- Justice
- Responsibility
- Restraint
- Hope

When you use all five of your hero's Motivations in a Story Arc, 
your hero's Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you
unlock your Nova Power Words and can use those until the
end of current Story Arc.

When a new Story Arc begins, all the marked off Motivations are 
cleared and it’s time to start again.


### Skills {#toc-skills .colbefore}

Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their 
civilian life -- from their secret identity, their profession 
before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training. 

The Skills are:

::::::::::::: twocolumn ::::::::::::::::::
- Academic

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Fighting Style {#toc-fighting-style .colbefore}

Your hero specializes in one style of fighting, whether they attack 
with their fists or their powers. Those styles are:

- **Acrobat** Reduce by 1 the cost to avoid a move targeting only you.
- **Brawler** Add 1 when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal.
- **Controller** Add 1 when you use a Power to advance the Outwit goal.
- **Frenzy** Add 1 when you use a Power to advance the Smash Goal.
- **Juggernaut** Add 1 when you use a Power to advance the Withstand goal.
- **Martial Artist** - Add 1 when you use an unarmed attack to advance the Outwit goal.
- **Protector** Reduce by 1 the cost to Take the Hit for someone else.
- **Sniper** Add 1 when you use a ranged Weapon to advance the Smash goal.
- **Tactician** Add 1 when you add to the Teamwork Pool.
- **Weaponmaster** Add 1 when you use a melee Weapon to advance the Outwit goal.

If you choose the Knight class, you get to pick an additional fighting style. 

### Power Words {#toc-powers .colbefore }

Your hero has a list of words called Power Words that define their
super-powers and how they use them. Power Words are used in three
different ways:

- A **Power Display**, which uses a single Power Word
- A **Power Stunt**, using two (or more) Power Words
- A **Power Combo**, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes

There are four types of Power Words:

- **Core Power Words**, unique to your class
- **Personal Power Words**, picked from your class list
- **Nova Power Words**, unique to your hero
- **Scene Power Words**, based on the situation

#### Core Power Words {#toc-power-words-core}

When you create your hero, you have two **Core Power Words** 
common to all members of your class. 
You don't have to choose them; you get them automatically.

#### Personal Power Words {#toc-power-words-personal}

In addition to Core Power Words, your hero also has 6 Personal Power Words. 
When you create your hero, choose these 6 from 
your class's list of 15 Personal Power Words. 
(If your class is Paragon, pick an extra one
from your class, and another from any class's list.)

#### Nova Power Words {#toc-power-words-nova}

Your **Nova Power Powers** can be anything; you're encouraged to use your 
Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.  

Like Motivations, you can choose any two words you like for
your hero's Nova Power Words.

Nova Power Words might look like this:

- Soaring Dragon
- Berserker Rage
- Indomitable Spirit
- Solar Flare

When you've completed your hero's Motivations track, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Story Arc.

#### Scene Power Words {#toc-power-words-scene}

Each scene where a Crisis takes places has up to 6 Power Words
that describe the environment around your heroes. 
These are known as **Scene Power Words.**

The Editor comes up with Scene Power Words when describing a location, 
and if you think creatively, you can use them in your Power Stunts and Combos.


### Your Hero's Identity {#toc-chargen-identity .colbefore}

[]{.lorem}


## Hero Classes {#toc-classes .breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}

The classes are:

Class       Description
----------- -------------------------
The Divine  Infused with the power of the Gods
The Knight  Normal human with extensive training
The Monarch Leader of a hidden kingdom
The Paragon Classically strong champion of good

[]{.lorem}

[]{.lorem}

### The Divine {#toc-divine .breakbefore .class}

[]{.lorem}

These examples will be removed:

- Examples: Wonder Woman, Thor, Shazam, Troia

#### Skills

You have the **Explorer**, **Historian**, and **Mystic** skills, plus two
additional skills of your choice.

Whenever you make a roll that uses your skill, roll an additional number of 
dice equal to the current Volume.

#### Class Ability: TBD

[]{.lorem}

#### Power Words

[]{.lorem}

##### Personal Power Words

Choose six Personal Power Words from the following list:

::::::::::::: cpw :::::::
- Anger
- Armor
- Command
- Extraplanar
- Flight
- Peace
- Radiant
- Resist
- Senses
- Speed
- Strength
- Thunder
- Unbreakable
- Weapon (specific)
- Wisdom
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you use a **Power Display,** you can add one Personal Power Word for free.

You can use two Power Personal Words together to form a **Power Stunt** or **Power Combo**
by paying 1 Might for each beyond the first.

##### Core Power Words

Your Core Power Words are **Divine** and **Assistance**.
You can spend 1 Might point to add one of these to a Power Stunt or Combo,
or 2 Might to add both.

##### Nova Power

Choose any two single words you like; these are your **Nova Power Words**.
When you complete your Motivations track, your Nova Power Words are **Unlocked**
until the end of the current Story Arc.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words in a Power Stunt or Combo for free; if you spend
1 Might, you can include the second Nova Power Word as well.


#### Divine Abilities {.colbefore .class}

[]{.lorem}

## Using Powers {#toc-power-use .breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}


### Power Displays {#toc-power-displays}

When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word
and explain how you're using that power.

A Power Display doesn't cost any Might points.

Power Displays don't have a game-mechanics effect on your rolls, but you
can use them to explain how you're able to *make* those rolls. 

For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it
as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to 
the skies to throw a punch. 

If you don't have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your
Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby 
skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.

### Power Stunts {#toc-power-stunts .colbefore}

A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together, and unlike
a Power Display, a Stunt will affect the result of your next roll.
In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.

When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words
and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you're
hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe
what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory
effects.

After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an
appropriate roll for your Power Stunt -- either to increase the
Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an
additional 1 Success to the Effectiveness of the roll based on your Stunt.

You don't have to come up with Power Stunts beforehand; instead,
you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your
creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.

For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you
could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase
"Flight Speed". Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt
means that when you make a roll -- such as rolling your Adventure
Facet to Outwit a foe -- increases your roll's Effectiveness by
1 Success, even if you rolled 0 Successes.


### Power Combos {#toc-power-combos .colbefore}

A **Power Combo** is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work
together, with their powers combined. 

To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they'd
like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you're trying
to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are
taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.

You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long
as you can come up with an explanation of how they're helping.

The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, 
and they're called the initiating hero for that Combo.

A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt -- the player of the
initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them,
spending 1 point of Might and increasing the Effectiveness
of the next roll by 1 Success.

The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another
Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which increases the roll's
Effectiveness by 1 Success.

Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one 
of their Core Power Words as a *third* (or fourth) Power Word in 
the Combo.

For example, []{.lorem}

</div>

### Using Personal Power Words {#toc-power-use-personal .colbefore}

[]{.lorem}

### Using Core Power Words {#toc-power-use-core .colbefore}

You can use one of your Core Power Words as a *third* Power Word 
in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, 
and adds another 1 Success to the Effectiveness of a roll.

By spending yet 1 *more* Might point you can add your *other* 
Core Power Word as a *fourth* Power Word in a Power Stunt. 
Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 Successes on the rolls
Effectiveness, but also costs you 3 Might points.

For example,  []{.lorem}

### Using Nova Power Words {#toc-power-use-nova .colbefore}

Once you've completed your hero's Motivations track, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Story Arc.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words as the *second* Power
Word in a Stunt without spending any Might; likewise, you can add 
use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the 
Nova Power Word still increases the roll's Effectiveness by 1 Success.

Using your *other* Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or
Power Combo requires spending 1 Might. 

For example, []{.lorem}

### Scene Power Words {#toc-power-use-scene}

Each scene has up to 6 Scene Power Words, chosen by the Editor.

You can use one Scene Power Word as a second Power Word in a 
Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, 
but they still contribute 1 Success to the Effectiveness of a roll.

Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, 
and it likewise increases the Effectiveness of that Combo.

For example, []{.lorem}


## Crisis {#toc-crisis .breakbefore}

Any encounter requiring your hero's unique superheroic talents and 
powers is known as a **Crisis.**
A Crisis could be anything from a natural disaster to a runaway
train; from a group of normal criminals to one or more super-powered
villains.

There isn't a separate game system for combats and fights; those use
the same system as any other Crisis.

Each Crisis is rated in three **Goals** that describe how the heroes 
could tackle that Crisis:

- **Smash** - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Withstand** - outlast the Crisis by taking all it can throw at you

### Countdown to Crisis {#toc-crisis-countdown .colbefore}

A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem
and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a
location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need 
to present at the start of a Crisis.

The steps to take before a Crisis are:

5. Set the Scene
4. Determine who is Present
3. Define the Goals
2. Assemble the Teamwork Pool
1. The Crisis begins!

#### Setting the Scene {#toc-crisis-scene}

[]{.lorem}

#### Determining Who is Present {#toc-crisis-present}

[]{.lorem}

#### Defining the Goals {#toc-crisis-goals}

[]{.lorem}

#### Assembling the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-pool}

When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the 
initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of 
describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving
a Crisis. 

If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero
reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using
a Facet related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to
the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for
their heroes.

If your hero is *not* on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it's
being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend
from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.

Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, it’s time to start.

### Starting a Crisis {#toc-crisis-start}

Instead of having an initiative order like many games of this type, 
there are two phases that alternate back and forth: 
the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase. 

The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is 
the Hero Phase.

### Hero Phase {#toc-crisis-hero .colbefore}

The heroes can each take one action during the Hero Phase, one at a time, 
in any order they like.

While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially three
things you can choose to do: Advance a Goal, Contribute to the Teamwork Pool,
or Save Innocents.

If your hero is *not* present, you can use the Timely Arrival action.

#### Timely Arrival {#toc-crisis-timely}

When you use the Timely Arrival action, spend 5 successes from the
Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current Hero Phase. 

You can't take any other actions that turn, but you *can* describe 
your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. 
Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.

The cost of the Timely Arrival action decreases by 1 success every
Crisis Phase.

#### General Alert {#toc-crisis-alert}

If two or more heroes aren't present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at 
the scene can use their turn to sound a General Alert and call for help.
The cost of a General Alert is 1 success per hero called.

The heroes arrive at the start of the *next* Hero Phase, and can act
normally during that turn. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike
a Timely Arrival, they don't roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.

#### Advance a Goal {#toc-crisis-advance}

When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the 
Crisis. There are three different ways of doing this:

- **Smash** - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Withstand** - outlast the Crisis, taking all it can throw at you

The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to 
advance it once. You don’t need to roll all these successes at once; 
you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too. 

Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, the Crisis ends.
The players have successfully Smashed, Outwitted, or Withstood the danger.

#### Contribute to the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-contribute}

When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions 
that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything 
you can think of that might give your team an edge. 

You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, 
or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes. 

When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness
to the Teamwork Pool. 

[]{.lorem}

#### Saving Innocents {#toc-crisis-saving}

[]{.lorem}

### Crisis Phase {#toc-crisis-crisis .colbefore}

Once every hero has taken an action, then it’s time for the Editor
to take their turn.

Every Crisis has a set number of turns per round. As a rule, the more 
actions a Crisis gets per turn, the more difficult it is. 
If the Crisis has the same number of actions as the hero team,
it will be very challenging.

The Editor chooses actions from the Encounter’s list. Every action has 
a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes from the 
Teamwork Pool, they defend against the attack and nothing happens.

For every action the Crisis tries to take, the heroes have an opportunity 
to spend successes from the Teamwork Pool to defend. If there aren’t 
enough successes in the pool to defend, or if the heroes decide not to defend, 
then the action happens and the heroes face the consequences. 

Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting 
the heroes' ability to use a certain type of roll on their next turn,
or innocents being endangered.

Once the Editor has taken enough actions, it’s time to go back to the heroes.

### Post-Crisis {#toc-crisis-post .colbefore}

[]{.lorem}


## Advancements {#toc-advancements .breakbefore}

  - Add one Fighting Style.
- If you were the Spotlight Hero, increase any one Facet by 1.

- (optional) Change your Story Arc if you haven't already completed it.

At the end of each Volume:

- Pick a new Class ability from the new Volume or a previous Volume.
- Create a new Story Arc for the new Volume.
- (optional) Retcon one of the following: your Class, your Personal Power Word choices, your Fighting Style choice(s), your Skill choices, or your Nova Power Words.
- (optional) Choose a new Costume, Symbol, or Hero Name.

          of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor 
          to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of 
          the Adapter’s License You apply.

       a. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
          or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
          Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    1. No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as 
       permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed 
       Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status 
       by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in 
       Section 3(A)(1)(a)(i).

       License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; 
       however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to 
       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to 
       allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
       
    1. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License.

    1. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties 
       from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a

    database for Anti-Capitalist purposes only;
    
A.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in 
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is 
    Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(B); and
    
A.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(A) if You Share all or a 
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace 
    Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other 
    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

A.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent 
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and 
    makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed 
    Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without 
    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the 
    presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where 
    disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer 
    may not apply to You.

A.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on 
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

A.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
    6(A), it reinstates:

       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(B) does not affect any right the 
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed 
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed 
    Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.

    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
    conditions of this License.

    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
    Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this 
    License.

A.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed 
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall 
    be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the 
    remaining terms and conditions.

A.  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply 
    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

A.  Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation 
    upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or 
    You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
