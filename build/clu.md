## Ethos {#toc-ethos .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} revolves around the following three pillars:

### Self Expression

The Power Word system and Crisis system are intentionally built to 
give players freedom to engage with problems in their own style. 
[]{.gamename} lets you be yourself, and do things in your own way, 
without being left behind by your team.

### Teamwork

[]{.gamename} games is written to encourage the players to work 
together. Whether you're combining your powers to use Power Combos
or using your skills to overcome an opponent together, heroes in 
[]{.gamename} succeed or fail as a team.

### Difficult Choices

The Edge Success system is built so that you have the freedom 
to choose failure. The Crisis system is built so that you can 
choose to take big hits. Good things and bad things happen to
your hero, and both of these are in the your hands to choose. 
The Editor’s job is to give you those difficult choices.


:::::::::::::::: {.soapbox #soapbox-0 } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### No Fascists

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) or something.

### Influences {#toc-influences}

At its heart, []{.gamename} is one of the multitude superhero
games that have come out of the TTRPG hobby -- I've played
Champions, I've played GURPS; I've played DC Heroes, I've
played Marvel Super Heroes; I've played Mutants & Masterminds,
I've played Marvel Heroic Roleplay.

The Harmony Drive system is a nifty system with a lot of very
cool mechanics, and the SRD is a lovely work of art itself.

So obviously, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants here. 
I just hope that []{.gamename} is a worthy contribution to 
the genre and other people can enjoy the game.

## Safety Tools {#safety .breakbefore}

Playing the []{.gamename} RPG should be enjoyable for everyone.

To ensure that everyone has an enjoyable experience, we recommend techniques
from the *TTRPG Safety Toolkit* that we've included below. 
You should not play []{.gamename} without using at least
one such tool in your game.


::::::::::::::::::: { .soapbox #soapbox-2 } ::::::::::::::::::::::

### Influences

The Super Friends

:   We'll start with the name and the cover art: This game
    is obviously inspired by the 
    [Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends)
    animated television show that was on the air from 1973 
    to 1985 -- incidentally the years that yours truly was
    between five and sixteen.
    
    To say the show had a formative influence might be overselling 
    it, but it *did* influence how I view comics and superheroes
    in general.
    
    The first season has this great opening monologue where
    the late, great Ted Knight intoned that the four heroes --
    obviously, Robin doesn't count for some reason? -- were
    "created from the cosmic legends of the universe!"
    
    What on earth does *that* mean? I *guess* I could see that
    applying to Wonder Woman, but how exactly was Bruce Wayne
    created from the cosmic legends of the universe?!
    
    It was never really clear, but decades later I decided it
    would make a great title for this Bronze-Age, four-color
    tabletop roleplaying game.

### What are safety tools?

Sometimes games have content or situations
where a player or Editor may feel stressed out,
unsafe, or otherwise not having fun. Safety tools
are a way for players and Editors to communicate
and check-in before, during, and after a game in
order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and
to provide the right support when needed.

Communication, trust, and care
The key to safety tools is communication and
trust. There needs to be open and respectful
communication alongside a culture of trust for
these to work.

As an Editor, player, or organizer, you can create
this culture by making it clear that the care and
well-being of everyone at the table comes before
the game or story. This can be done by actively
listening to everyone, offering accomodations and
safety tools, implementing actions when asked
while not prying (nobody owes you their trauma
as explanation), and actively checking in before,
during, and after a game.

#### Before the Game Begins

[]{.lorem}

##### Session 0

Session 0s are a great way to begin
communication, set expectations on the kind of
story and play, and introduce and discuss what
safety tools will be used at the table.

##### Lines and Veils

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries
on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on
content, things that the Editor or the players don’t
want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are
soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means
that the content might be in the game but not
spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the
game.

##### Script Change Rating

**Script Change** ratings are used to set tone and
boundaries for your game. Using film ratings (or
your own), you can outline what audience you’re
playing for (e.g. PG-13 vs R). 

The **rating** also
addresses what content players do want to see
as well as what they don’t want to see. Make sure
to balance and respect everyone’s do and don’t
wants. 

**Ratings** and do-and-don’t-want content can
be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

#### During the Game

[]{.lorem}

##### X, N, and O Cards

**X**, **N**, and **O cards** are check-in tools. They can be
used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in
the chat function of the video conference software
or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand
signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone
that they are available and how to use them.

The **X card** can be used at any point if a
participant is uncomfortable with the content
happening in-game. When the **X card** is used by
tapping the card or typing an **“X”** in the chat, the
group can change, rewind, or skip the content.

The **N card** can be used at any point if a participant
feels like they are headed towards an X. When the
**N card** is used by tapping the card or typing an
**“N”** in the chat, the group can change the content
or have the scene “fade to black.”

The **O card** can be used at any point if a
participant wants to continue with the content.
When the **O card** is used by tapping the card
or typing an **“O”** in the chat, the group is ok to
continue with the content. They can also regularly
be prompted by a **“O?”** asked out loud or in the
chat to check-in if everyone is still ok.

#### Script Change

The **Script Change RPG Toolbox** is a collection
of tools that can be used to adjust play and
content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the
video conference software or virtual tabletop you
are using, or using hand signals. Before the game
begins, remind your players that they are available
and how to use them.

[Rewind]{.icon .rewind} can be used when something
has happened in play that makes a participant
uncomfortable. When [Rewind]{.icon .rewind} is used by
tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to rewind...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a
point before it happened, and play starts again.

[Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} can be used when a
participant would like to skip past uncomfortable
content or to the next part of the story for pacing.
When [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to fast forward...”), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

[Pause]{.icon .pause} can be used when things are too
intense, but you still want to continue playing the
scene. When [Pause]{.icon .pause} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to pause...”), you can take a break
and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
[Pause]{.icon .pause}, you can [Resume]{.icon .resume}, 
[Rewind]{.icon .rewind}, [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff}.

[Resume]{.icon .resume} can be used when everyone is ready
to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing
content. When [Resume]{.icon .resume} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“Let’s resume...”), continue with play.

##### Open Door

The **Open Door** is the assurance that someone
can leave or take a break from the game for their
own safety and well-being without being judged.
State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

##### Breaks

For games longer than 2 hours or games that have
intense content, having a short built-in break is
recommended to allow people to stay focused and
process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any
other needs during this time.

#### After the Game

[]{.lorem}

##### Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over
into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment
of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships
between players and Editor if not worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game
begins and ends, and being conscious of which
feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

##### Stars and Wishes

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the
session and communicate feedback in a positive
and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed
and loved about the game. This could include a
particular moment of roleplay, a Crisis created
by the Editor, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular
interactions between heroes, potential story
moments and development, or anything else that
could make the game even better in the future.

##### Highlight Reel and Wrap Session

Similar to **stars and wishes**, Script Change
has **Highlight Reel** and **Wrap Session**. 

The **Highlight Reel** is used to reflect on the session
and highlight moments participants enjoyed. At
the end of the game, go around and get everyone
to state highlight of the game for them. This
could include a particular moment of roleplay,
Crisi created by the Editor, or anything else
that stuck out as something awesome during the
game. 

The **Wrap Session** is an opportunity for the
group to reflect on the session and discuss what
could be improved going forward. At the end of the
game, go around and open up discussion about
the game. This could include content participants
didn’t feel comfortable calling pause or rewind at
the time, or talking about emotional impacts and bleed.

There should be no social pressure to disclose
the details or trauma to justify why someone felt
uncomfortable or unsafe during the game, as long
as the discussion moves towards how to address
the issues going forward.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Rolling Dice {#toc-dice .breakbefore}

The dice mechanic in []{.gamename} is a pool of six-sided dice. 
When a player wants to take an uncertain action, they build a dice pool.

- One die for every point they have in the relevant Facet
- One die for every Volume if they have a relevant Skill
- Two dice if they can mark off a relevant part of their Motivation
- One die for every Power Word beyond the first

Any dice that come up a 5 or a 6 are counted as Successes. 
A challenging task can require 1-3 Successes to complete (outside combat).

Any dice that come up 2, 3, or 4 are ignored.

Any dice that come up 1 are counted as Edge Successes. 
When a player rolls a 1, they inform the Editor, 
who offers them a consequence. 

If the player chooses to take the Editor’s consequence, 
they count the 1 as a Success.

This consequence can be mechanical, like losing Health, or it can be 
narrative, like upsetting an NPC or missing an important clue. 
The important part is that the player is presented with a difficult choice.

### The Ages of Comics

American comics fans and scholars divide the history of U.S.
comics into four loosely defined "ages": the Golden Age, the
Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Modern Age.

The Golden Age - 1938 to 1956

:   The Golden Age started with the introduction of Superman,
    and the creation of the superhero model that's been used for years. 
  
    Many of the most well-known characters, such as Wonder Woman 
    and Captain America, were created during the Golden Age.
  
    Some comics in the Golden Age were just simplistic fun, while
    others feature dark themes, shocking gore, and vile villains.
    There was a lot of punching Nazis back in those days.
    Punching Nazis is always a good thing. 
  
    Unfortunately, racism and sexism often were major themes in Golden 
    Age comics; examples of anti-Asian hatred are all too easy to find.

Contined [](#soapbox-4){.onpage}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
  

## Issues, Story Arcs, Series, and Volumes {#toc-issues .breakbefore}

An adventure in []{.gamename} is known as a Story. A Story
consists of one or more Crises introduced by the Editor, and
the heroes' reactions to those challenges.

Each individual game session is known as an Issue. 
Most Stories will resolve over one Issue, but some can take longer.

When you create a new hero, you define a Story Arc that describes 
a specific lesson you'd like them to learn or a specific experience 
you'd like them to have.  Once your hero finishes your Story Arc, 
both your hero and your fellow players' heroes gain an Advancement.

A ongoing campaign of []{.gamename} is known as a Series, 
and each Series is comprised of up to five Volumes, beginning
with Volume 1.

Once all of the heroes have had a chance to play out their Story Arcs, 
the Editor and heroes play out a final Issue that ties together 
the previous Story Arcs, and that Volume ends.

At the end of a Volume, your hero develops new powers or finds 
new ways to use their existing powers.


::::::::::::::::::: { .soapbox #soapbox-4 } ::::::::::::::::::::::

### The Ages of Comics

The Silver Age - 1956 to circa 1970

:   The Silver Age began when DC Comics
    created new versions of the Flash, Green Lantern, and others,
    then the Justice League of America. Marvel responded by
    creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Avengers,
    and the Hulk.
  
    With American society talking about "the atomic age" and 
    "the space age," comics followed suit -- creating heroes
    with pseudo-scientific explanations.
  
    The Atom wasn't just a short guy who punched people, but scientist 
    with a size-shifting belt made of "white dwarf matter".
    Green Lantern doesn't have a *magic* ring; I'm not saying it
    came from aliens, but it came from aliens.
    Experiments gone wrong produced so many heroes at Marvel Comics,
    including the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man.
  
    "Radiation" was everywhere -- not the type that gives you cancer,
    but magical sort of radiation that blasted hapless individuals
    and turned them into monsters, heroes, or both.
  
    Another feature of the Silver Age was the Comics Code Authority,
    a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic
    over the content of comics -- including congressional hearings,
    book burnings, and the disputed *Seduction of the Innocent*
    book by Fredric Wertham.
  
    Mainstream comics in the Silver Age therefore followed a long list of 
    prescriptions known as the Comics Code that banned everything
    from "horror" and "gore" to "vampires" and "cannibalism". 
    Heroes in the Silver Age always won, villains always got what
    was comin' to 'em, and authority figures were portrayed 
    positively -- or at least, that's what the CCA demanded.

- Choose a Hero Name, Pronouns, and a Real Name, and decide whether the latter is a Secret Identity
- Describe your Costume, Symbol, and General Appearance


::::::::::::::::::: { .soapbox #soapbox-5 } ::::::::::::::::::::::

#### The Ages of Comics

The Bronze Age - ca. 1970 to ca. 1985

:   The Bronze Age (circa 1970 to circa 1985) is less distinctly
    defined chronologically, but it's an era where comics went
    through changes: becoming more socially relevant and less
    restrained by the CCA. More on that later.
  
Continued [](#soapbox-6){.onpage}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Facets {#toc-facets}

Each hero's nature is defined by their scores in 5 different facets, 
which represent their approaches to solving problems.

- **Action** - a direct, straight-forward approach
- **Adventure** - a reactive approach, adapting to changing situations
- **Detective** - a logical approach, based on gathering information
- **Mystery** - a subtle approach, incorporating hidden motives and actions
- **Suspense** - an approach based on using the senses to become aware of the environment

Each of your hero's facets start with a score of 1, and you have 5 
additional points to distribute to them.

::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Designer's Note: Facets 

These Facets -- named for key Golden Age or Silver Age comic titles --
were chosen to express how a hero chooses to solve problems, not 
any innate or immutable characteristics they may have. 
A hero in a Harmony Drive game can be as physically strong as they like, 
or as wise or charming as they like.

The other reason for these Facets is that the concept of Intelligence 
as a concrete and immutable quality of a person is ableist. 
It has been used to excuse eugenics and countless other atrocities, 
including racial and class injustice. 

We chose “Detective" as a measure of a hero’s willingness to solve 
problems by thinking about them and gathering information, 
not as a measure of their “intelligence” or, heaven forbid, “IQ”.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Motivations {#toc-motivation .colbefore}

Your hero has five Motivations that drive them to feats of 
heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen
by you when you create your hero; there's no set list.

For example, one hero could have these five Motivations:

- Truth
- Justice
- Responsibility
- Restraint
- Hope

When you use all five of your hero's Motivations in a Story Arc, 
your hero's Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you
unlock your Nova Power Words and can use those until the
end of current Story Arc.

When a new Story Arc begins, all the marked off Motivations are 
cleared and it’s time to start again.


::::::::::::::::::: { .soapbox #soapbox-6 } ::::::::::::::::::::::

### The Ages of Comics

The Modern Age - ca. 1985 to present

:   The start current age of comics is usually dated to the 
    *Crisis on Infinite Earths* and *Secret Wars* 12-issue series
    published by DC Comics and Marvel Comics, respectively.
    Worlds lived, worlds died, and nothing the creators dreamed of
    was impossible for the publishers to accomplish.

    Darker, mature themes were explored in revitalized titles like
    the *Teen Titans* and *X-Men*, while heroes such as Superman
    and Daredevil had their backstories revamped and retooled
    for a contemporary setting. Antiheroes such as the Punisher
    flourish in the current age of comics.

    The CCA also died off during this period as the major publishers
    increasingly created comics without the CCA seal on the cover, 
    and the Comics Code withered away to nothing.

### Fighting Style {#toc-fighting-style .colbefore}

Your hero specializes in one style of fighting, whether they attack 
with their fists or their powers. Those styles are:

- **Brawler** Add 2 dice to the dice poolwhen you use an unarmed attack to advance the Smash goal.
- **Controller** Add 2 dice to the dice pool when you use a Power to advance the Outwit goal.
- **Frenzy** Add 2 dice to the dice pool when you use a Power to advance the Smash Goal.

#### "Four-Color"

The term "four-color" refers to the printing process used
in comics that led to most heroes having bold, primary
colors for their uniforms, their bodies, their world.

One example is Superman's hair having *blue* overtones --
this was clearly meant to display his hair as lustrous
color of black, but that was beyond the capabilities used
at the time, so they published comics with that weird blue
highlight.

But don't worry -- our use of the term "four-color" doesn't
refer to the printing process we use in this game (although
the PDFs do support 
[2021's CMYK color printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model), 
but instead to the general tone and feel of late Silver-Age
and Bronze-Age comics, when primary-color superheroes of the
1950s and '60s were meeting the social issues of the '70s
and '80s.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Skills {#toc-skills .colbefore}

Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their 
civilian life -- from their secret identity, their profession 
before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training. 

The Skills are:

::::::::::::: twocolumn ::::::::::::::::::
- Academic
- Artist
- Criminal
- Deputy
- Engineer
- Explorer
- Hacker
- Historian
- Investigator
- Journalist
- Lawyer
- Mystic
- Performer
- Physician
- Pilot
- Politician
- Scientist
- Socialite
- Spy
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as
determined by your class, which may also give additional skills.

Keep in mind that []{.gamename} is a four-color game, not a simulation
of reality -- so skills follow "comic book logic" rather than working
as they really *should* in real life.

#### Skill Descriptions

The skills in []{.gamename} are listed below, along with 3 to 5 ways
of using those with your hero's Facets and suggestions the Editor can

### Power Words {#toc-powers .colbefore }

Your hero has a list of words called Power Words that define their
super-powers and how they use them. Power Words are used in three
different ways:

- A **Power Display**, which uses a single Power Word
- A **Power Stunt**, using two (or more) Power Words
- A **Power Combo**, with Power Words from two (or more) heroes

There are four types of Power Words:

- **Core Power Words**, unique to your class
- **Personal Power Words**, picked from your class list
- **Nova Power Words**, unique to your hero
- **Scene Power Words**, based on the situation

#### Core Power Words {#toc-power-words-core}

When you create your hero, you have two **Core Power Words** 
common to all members of your class. 
You don't have to choose them; you get them automatically.

#### Personal Power Words {#toc-power-words-personal}

In addition to Core Power Words, your hero also has 6 Personal Power Words. 
When you create your hero, choose these 6 from 
your class's list of 15 Personal Power Words. 
(If your class is Paragon, pick an extra one
from your class, and another from any class's list.)

#### Nova Power Words {#toc-power-words-nova}

Your **Nova Power Powers** can be anything; you're encouraged to use your 
Nova Power Words to give your hero a unique ability.  

Like Motivations, you can choose any two words you like for
your hero's Nova Power Words.

Nova Power Words might look like this:

- Soaring Dragon
- Berserker Rage
- Indomitable Spirit
- Solar Flare

When you've completed your hero's Motivations track, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Story Arc.

#### Scene Power Words {#toc-power-words-scene}

Each scene where a Crisis takes places has up to 6 Power Words
that describe the environment around your heroes. 
These are known as **Scene Power Words.**

The Editor comes up with Scene Power Words when describing a location, 
and if you think creatively, you can use them in your Power Stunts and Combos.

## Using Powers {#toc-power-use .breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}


### Power Displays {#toc-power-displays}

When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word
and explain how you're using that power.

A Power Display doesn't cost any Might points.

Power Displays don't have a game-mechanics effect on your rolls, but you
can use them to explain how you're able to *make* those rolls. 

For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it
as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to 
the skies to throw a punch. 

If you don't have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your
Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby 
skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.

### Power Stunts {#toc-power-stunts .colbefore}

A Power Stunt consists of two Power Words joined together, and unlike
a Power Display, a Stunt will affect the result of your next roll.
In addition, each use of a Stunt requires you to spend 1 point of Might.

When you use a Power Stunt, choose two words from your Power Words
and put them together in a two-word phrase, then describe what you're
hoping to accomplish with that Stunt. You can also describe
what the Stunt looks like, feels like, and any other sensory
effects.

After spending 1 Might on the Power Stunt, you can then make an
appropriate roll for your Power Stunt -- either to increase the
Teamwork Pool or to decrease one of the Goals in a Crisis. Add an
additional die to the dice pool for each Power Word beyond the first.

You don't have to come up with Power Stunts beforehand; instead,
you create them on the fly during a Crisis, blending together your
creativity with the ever-evolving situation in the game.

For example, if you have the Flight and Speed Power Words, you
could join those together for a Power Stunt with the phrase
"Flight Speed". Spending 1 point of Might on this Stunt
means that when you make a roll -- such as rolling your Adventure
Facet to Outwit a foe -- increases the number of dice in your pool
by 1 die.


### Power Combos {#toc-power-combos .colbefore}

A **Power Combo** is a Power Stunt where two or more heroes work
together, with their powers combined. 

To use a Power Combo, ask one of your fellow players if they'd
like to form a Power Combo with you and tell them what you're trying
to accomplish. Together you describe the action your heroes are
taking and how their powers work to produce the needed effect.

You can invite as many players to join in as you like, as long
as you can come up with an explanation of how they're helping.

The players decide whose hero is central to the Power Combo, 
and they're called the initiating hero for that Combo.

A Power Combo starts with a Power Stunt -- the player of the
initiating hero chooses two Power Words and combines them,
spending 1 point of Might and increasing the number of dice
of their next roll by 1 Success.

The other players each spend 1 Might and contribute another
Power Word to the Power Combo, each of which adds a die to the
dice pool.

Only the initiating hero can spend additional Might to use one 
of their Core Power Words as a *third* (or fourth) Power Word in 
the Combo.

### Using Personal Power Words {#toc-power-use-personal .colbefore}

[]{.lorem}

### Using Core Power Words {#toc-power-use-core .colbefore}

You can use one of your Core Power Words as a *third* Power Word 
in a Power Stunt. Doing so costs 1 additional point of Might, 
and adds another 1 die to the dice pool on your roll.

By spending yet 1 *more* Might point you can add your *other* 
Core Power Word as a *fourth* Power Word in a Power Stunt. 
Collectively this gives a bonus of 3 dice in the dice pool,
but also costs you 3 Might points.

For example,  []{.lorem}

### Using Nova Power Words {#toc-power-use-nova .colbefore}

Once you've completed your hero's Motivations track, you unlock
your **Nova Power Words** and can use them until the end of 
the current Story Arc.

You can use one of your Nova Power Words as the *second* Power
Word in a Stunt without spending any Might; likewise, you can add 
use one as your contribution to a Combo for free. In both cases, the 
Nova Power Word still increases the roll's dice pool by 1 die.

Using your *other* Nova Power Word in the same Power Stunt or
Power Combo requires spending 1 Might. 

For example, []{.lorem}

### Scene Power Words {#toc-power-use-scene}

Each scene has up to 6 Scene Power Words, chosen by the Editor.

You can use one Scene Power Word as a second Power Word in a 
Power Stunt without spending any Might; Scene Power Words are free, 
but they still contribute 1 die to the dice pool.

Each Power Combo can also include one Scene Power Word for free, 
and it likewise increases the dice pool of that Combo.

For example, []{.lorem}


## Crisis {#toc-crisis .breakbefore}

Any encounter requiring your hero's unique superheroic talents and 
powers is known as a **Crisis.**
A Crisis could be anything from a natural disaster to a runaway
train; from a group of normal criminals to one or more super-powered
villains.

There isn't a separate game system for combats and fights; those use
the same system as any other Crisis.

Each Crisis is rated in three **Goals** that describe how the heroes 
could tackle that Crisis:

- **Smash** - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Withstand** - outlast the Crisis by taking all it can throw at you

### Countdown to Crisis {#toc-crisis-countdown .colbefore}

A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem
and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a
location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need 
to present at the start of a Crisis.

The steps to take before a Crisis are:

5. Set the Scene
4. Determine who is Present
3. Define the Goals
2. Assemble the Teamwork Pool
1. The Crisis begins!

#### Setting the Scene {#toc-crisis-scene}

[]{.lorem}

#### Determining Who is Present {#toc-crisis-present}

[]{.lorem}

##### Innocent Bystanders {.colbefore}

Superhero fights can be dangerous for people caught in the crossfire,
and most natural or manmade disasters place people in danger.

At the beginning of the Crisis, the Editor can assign points to the
Bystander Pool. Heroes can use the Save Innocents move to reduce
the size of the Bystander Pool, while the Crisis's moves can be
used to increase it.

When the Bystander Pool is reduced to zero, there are no longer any
endangered people, although in subsequent turns, the Crisis may add
more to this pool.

This table is a rough guideline for how many people are endangered
and how large the Bystander Pool should be:

  Pool             Number             Examples
----------------  ------------------  --------------------------------
       1           a couple, at best  A remote highway
       2               several        A mostly empty convenience store
       3               a bunch        A bank
       4                many          A small factory
       5               very many      A supermarket
       6                a *lot*       A hospital
       7                numerous      A school
       8+              a big crowd    A crowded rock concert

When a hero reduces the size of the Bystander Pool with the Save
Innocents move, they regain a number of Might points equal to the 
number of points removed. Protecting others reinvigorates the heroes
to fight on.

If a Crisis move reduces the size of the Bystander Pool, the same 
amount is *also* subtracted from the Teamwork Pool. Being unable to
save everyone is demoralizing to all heroes.

#### Defining the Goals {#toc-crisis-goals}

[]{.lorem}

#### Assembling the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-pool}

When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the 
initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of 
describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving
a Crisis. 

If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero
reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using
a Facet related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to
the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for
their heroes.

If your hero is *not* on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it's
being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend
from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.

Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, it’s time to start.

### Starting a Crisis {#toc-crisis-start}

Instead of having an initiative order like many games of this type, 
there are two phases that alternate back and forth: 
the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase. 

The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is 
the Hero Phase.

### Hero Phase {#toc-crisis-hero .colbefore}

The heroes can each take one move during the Hero Phase, one at a time, 
in any order they like.

While your hero is at the scene of a Crisis, there are essentially three
things you can choose to do: Advance a Goal, Contribute to the Teamwork Pool,
or Save Innocents.

If your hero is *not* present, you can use the Timely Arrival move.

#### Timely Arrival {#toc-crisis-timely}

When you use the Timely Arrival move, spend 5 successes from the
Teamwork Pool have your hero arrive at the end of the current Hero Phase. 

You can't make any other moves that turn, but you *can* describe 
your entry to the scene and make a roll related to your arrival. 
Add the Effectiveness of that roll to the Teamwork Pool.

The cost of the Timely Arrival move decreases by 1 success every
Crisis Phase.

#### General Alert {#toc-crisis-alert}

If two or more heroes aren't present at a Crisis, one of the heroes at 
the scene can use their turn to sound a General Alert and call for help.
The cost of a General Alert is 1 success per hero called.

The heroes arrive at the start of the *next* Hero Phase, and can act
normally during that turn. They can describe their arrivals, but unlike
a Timely Arrival, they don't roll to add to the Teamwork Pool.

#### Advance a Goal {#toc-crisis-advance}

When you Advance a Goal, your hero is taking a step toward resolving the 
Crisis. There are three different ways of doing this:

- **Smash** - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Withstand** - outlast the Crisis, taking all it can throw at you

The difficulty of each Goal is the number of successes needed to 
advance it once. You don’t need to roll all these successes at once; 
you can take successes from the Teamwork Pool too. 

Once the Goals have been advanced a total of five times, the Crisis ends.
The players have successfully Smashed, Outwitted, or Withstood the danger.

#### Contribute to the Teamwork Pool {#toc-crisis-contribute}

When you Contribute to the Pool, your hero is taking tactical actions 
that will give the team an advantage. This can be literally anything 
you can think of that might give your team an edge. 

You might swing to the top of a nearby skyscraper to get a better view, 
or you might cast a magical barrier to protect heroes. 

When you Contribute, make a skill roll and add the total Effectiveness
to the Teamwork Pool. 

[]{.lorem}

#### Save Innocents {#toc-crisis-saving}

When your hero uses the Save Innocents move, you can describe how they
are using their powers and abilities to protect people from danger, and
make a roll using an appropriate Facet.

If you succeed on the roll, you can remove a number of points equal to
the Effectiveness from the Bystander Pool. For each point removed, 
you regain 1 point of Might.

If you fail, the bystanders remain endangered, and the size of the
Bystander Pool remains the same.

### Crisis Phase {#toc-crisis-crisis .colbefore}

Once every hero has taken a move, then it’s time for the Editor
to take their turn.

Every Crisis has a set number of moves per turn. As a rule, the more 
moves a Crisis gets per turn, the more difficult it is. 
If the Crisis has the same number of moves as the hero team,
it will be very challenging.

The Editor chooses moves from the Encounter’s list of moves. Every
move has a cost next to it – if the heroes pay this many successes 
from the Teamwork Pool, they defend against that move and nothing 
happens.

If there aren’t enough successes in the pool to defend against the
move, or if the heroes decide not to counter the move, then the 
move happens and the heroes face the consequences. 

Possible consequences include losing Health, temporarily restricting 
the heroes' ability to use a certain type of roll or move on their 
next turn, or innocents being endangered.

Once the Editor has taken enough moves, it’s time to go back to the heroes.

### Post-Crisis {#toc-crisis-post .colbefore}

[]{.lorem}


## Advancements {#toc-advancements .breakbefore}

After each Story Arc concludes:

- Choose one Advancement from the following list; you can only add a Skill, Fighting Style, or Power Word once per Volume.
  - Increase your Health by 1.
  - Increase your Might by 1.
  - Add one Skill.
  - Add one Power Word from any class.
  - Add one Fighting Style.
- If you were the Spotlight Hero, increase any one Facet by 1.
- (optional) Change one of your Motivations to any other word.
- (optional) Change your Story Arc if you haven't already completed it.

At the end of each Volume:

- Pick a new Class ability from the new Volume or a previous Volume.
- Create a new Story Arc for the new Volume.
- (optional) Retcon one of the following: your Class, your Personal Power Word choices, your Fighting Style choice(s), your Skill choices, or your Nova Power Words.
- (optional) Choose a new Costume, Symbol, or Hero Name.

       a. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
          or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
          Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

       Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status 
       by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in

    database for Anti-Capitalist purposes only;
    
A.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in

A.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(A) if You Share all or a

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace 
    Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other 
    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

A.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent

    Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without 
    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the

    may not apply to You.

A.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on 
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
    Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this 
    License.

A.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed 
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall

    remaining terms and conditions.

A.  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply 
    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

    You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
