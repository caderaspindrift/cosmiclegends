# A Timeline of the Cosmic Legends Universe {#what-timeline}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::timeline-list:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **14 billion years ago**  *Everywhere* <br/> The universe comes into existence. Current science has no explanation for
how or why.


- **13.9 billion years ago**  *Unknown* <br/> The first form of life in universe arises under unexplained circumstances. 

These early life forms will evolve into the race that would be known to Earth and Titan as the Visitors.


- **13.8 billion years ago**  *Unknown* <br/> The first intelligent civilization in the universe, the Visitors, arises.


- **13.75 billion years ago**  *Unknown* <br/> Having attained interstellar space flight, the Visitors begin to explore the galaxy in large worldships.


- **9.2 billion years ago**  *The Solar System* <br/> Gravity causes matter in a molecular cloud to coalesce into the Sun and planets of the Solar System.

- **8.5 billion years ago**  *Andromeda Galaxy* <br/> Visitor explorers trigger a 28-minute gamma burst to alert their homeworld of the 
discovery of the race that would be known as the Ro'Tan'Okk -- the Titanians.

Earth-based scientists would later record the burst on Christmas day, 2010.


- **4 to 4.6 billion years ago**  *The planet Earth* <br/> The planet Earth and the Moon form.

- **4 billion years ago**  *The planet Saturn* <br/> Titan and the other moons of Saturn form.

- **3.85 billion years ago**  *The Solar System* <br/> Probes launched by the Visitors discover the Solar System and note the potential for 
life on Earth and Titan.

They leave behind multiple orbiting drones to monitor the planets and moons of the
Solar System.


- **3.77 billion years ago**  *The planet Earth* <br/> The earliest forms of life arise around thermal vents in the oceans.


- **3.5 billion years ago**  *The moon Titan* <br/> The earliest forms of life arise in the subsurface ammonia oceans.


- **3 billion years ago**  *The moon Titan* <br/> After millenia of experimentation, the Visitors leave the Ro'Tan'Okk on Titan.


- **2 billion years ago**  *The moon Titan* <br/> The Ro'Tan'Okk -- survivors of millennia of experimentation by the Visitors -- 
form an organization of astronomers and soldiers to watch for the return of 
their previous captors.

These would come to be known on Earth as the Sentinels of Saturn.
 <br/>See also: *Titan*

- **200 to 500 million years ago**  *Everywhere* <br/> The "Cosmic Dark Age" of the universe ends as stars and galaxies begin to form."


- **ca. 1,000 BCE**  *The South Pacific* <br/> Humans experimented on by the Visitors steal a shuttle craft and crash
in the Pacific Ocean near an uninhabited chain of volcanic islands. 

Reverse-engineering Visitor technologies, they eventually devise a 
magnetic field that protects their islands from discovery. The
existence of the Vulcanors would remain hidden until 1956.


- **5th Century, CE**  *Post-Roman Britain* <br/> Ambrosius Aurelianus, who would later become known in legend as \"King Arthur\",
established an order of knights at Camulodunum.


- **6th Century, CE**  *Camulodunum, Post-Roman Britain* <br/> Perceval, a Welsh knight in Arthur's court, swears to recover the Holy Grail. 
Through unexplained means, he became immortal and is known as the Grailknight, one
of the founding members of the Cosmic Legends.


- **August, 1900**  *Belfast, South Africa* <br/> Sir Percival, who would later be called the Grailknight, was captured at the 
Battle of Bergendal after fighting alongside the Boers against the British as part
of the Irish Transvaal Brigade during the Second Anglo-Boer War. He was sent to
a POW camp on the island of Saint Helena but escaped within a week.


- **May, 1910**  *St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle* <br/> Sir Percival, the Grailknight, was sighted here paying his respects. He wouldn't be

killing several.

Survivor Kitty Farrington was saved by the intervention of the
Tuatha Dé Danann, who transformed her into their champion, Sequana.
She later joins the British Merchant Navy, over objections of the Oireachtas 
Éireann -- who sought to enforce Ireland's neutrality in World War II.

Sequana's actions during the war led to political discrimination when she
returned to Ireland after D-Day, and she soon emigrated to the United States,
where she operated as the first public \"super-hero\" in America.


- **March, 1941**  *The South Pacific* <br/> Fearing that war in Europe and the  Pacific may be inevitable, U.S. scientists 
clone dinosaurs and implant them with control circuits to use as disposable
soldiers.

founded; instead, all space operations would remain under military control.)


- **July, 1949**  *The South Pacific* <br/> A U.S. pilot reported sighting the G.I. Dinosaurs on an island near what
would later be revealed as the Vulcanor island chain. The later activities 
of the 'Dinosaurs are not recorded.

Young prince Obsidius and the Volcano City Militia join the fight, revealing the 
presence of Vulcanians to the outside world.
 <br/>See also: *The Visitors*

- **January, 1957**  *The moon Jarnsaxa* <br/> The Kyl'Sh'Tal's listening post on Jarnsaxa destroyed by the retreating Visitor worldship 
when the post's cloaking screens fail under mysterious circumstances.

All personnel, including Ty'Tonn To'Rezz's three spouses and their sibling My'Tonn, are 
killed.

- **March, 1957**  *Outside the orbit of Neptune* <br/> Having discovered the devastation of Jarnsaxa, Ty'Tonn and Obsidius pursue the 
Visitor worldship and free a group of kidnapped humans who were being subjected to 
medical experiments. Upon being returned to Earth, these humans became known as the
